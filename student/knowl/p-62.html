<p>In this section, we begin to explore some of the arithmetic and algebraic properties of \(\Z\text{.}\) We focus specifically on the divisibility and factorization properties of the integers, as these are the main focus of the text as a whole. One of the primary goals of this section is to formalize definitions that you are likely already familiar with and of which you have an intuitive understanding. At first, this might seem to unnecessarily complicate matters. However, it will become clear as we move forward that formal mathematical language and notation are necessary to extend these properties to a more abstract setting. We begin with a familiar notion.</p>
