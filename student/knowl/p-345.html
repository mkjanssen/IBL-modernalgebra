<p>Notice that the reason the idea of zero divisors at first appears weird is that they are not something we encounter when working with our familiar sets of numbers, such as \(\Z\) or \(\R\text{.}\) In fact, we specifically use the fact that there are no zero divisors in our familiar numbers systems to solve equations in high school algebra (e.g., if \((x-2)(x+5)=0\text{,}\) then \((x-2)=0\) or \(x+5=0\)). The lack of zero divisors is one of the properties that does not persist in our abstraction from the integers to rings in general.</p>
