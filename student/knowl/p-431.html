<p>One of the ways in which mathematicians study the <em class="emphasis">structure</em> of an abstract object is by considering how it interacts with other (related) objects. This is especially true of its <em class="emphasis">sub</em>objects. Thus, in linear algebra, we are often concerned with <em class="emphasis">subspaces</em> of a vector space as a means of understanding the vector space, or even submatrices as a way of understanding a matrix (see, e.g., the cofactor expansion formula for the determinant). In real analysis and topology, the important subobjects are usually open sets, or subsequences, and the study of a graph's subgraphs is an important approach to many questions in graph theory.</p>
