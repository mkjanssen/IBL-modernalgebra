<p>The notion of an ideal number was first introduced by Ernst Kummer middle of the nineteenth century. Kummer was studying the cyclotomic integers in connection to work on Fermat's Last Theorem and reciprocity laws in number theory, and discovered, to use our modern terminology, that these rings of cyclotomic integers were not UFDs. In particular, he found irreducible cyclotomic integers that were not prime. His work, which was finished by Richard Dedekind by 1871, was to define a new class of complex number, an <em class="emphasis">ideal number</em> for which unique factorization into prime ideal numbers held. This notion of ideal number was later elaborated on by David Hilbert and Emmy Noether into the more general version which we stated in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def-ideal.html" title="Definition 2.4.1">Definition 2.4.1</a>.</p>
