<p>How did you answer the last question in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act-gcdcomputations.html" title="Activity 1.2.3">Activity 1.2.3</a>? If you are like the authors' classes, the answers probably varied, though you have referred at some point to a "prime" (<a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def-primeinteger.html" title="Definition 1.3.1">whatever those are</a>), or possibly some other ad hoc method for finding the gcd. Most such methods rely in some form on our ability to factor integers. However, the problem of factoring arbitrary integers is actually surprisingly computationally intensive. Thankfully, there is another way to compute \(\gcd(a,b)\text{,}\) to which we now turn.</p>
