<p>Our last major abstraction from \(\Z\) is the division algorithm. The main obstacle to postulating domains with a division algorithm is a clear notion of comparison relations. That is, if \(R\) is an arbitrary domain with \(r,s\in R\text{,}\) is it possible to clearly and sensibly say which of \(r\) or \(s\) is “bigger” ? (Recall that this was a requirement for the division algorithm with nonzero remainders.) However, if there is a way to relate elements of a domain \(R\) to \(\N_0\text{,}\) we can sensibly define a division algorithm.</p>
