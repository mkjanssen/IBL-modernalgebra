<p>How does your definition treat the number 1? The primality of 1 has been the subject of much debate stretching back to the Greeks (most of whom did not consider 1 to be a number). Throughout history, mathematicians have at times viewed 1 as prime, and at other times, not prime. The main argument for the non-primality of 1 is that if 1 were taken to be prime, we would need to word theorems like the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (below) in such a way that only prime factorizations not including 1 can be considered. For, if 1 is prime, we would have to consider, e.g., \(6 = 2\cdot 3 = 1\cdot 2 \cdot 3 = 1\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 3\) as three different factorizations of 6 into primes.</p>
