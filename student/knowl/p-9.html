<p>The focus of the first three chapters is <em class="emphasis">factorization</em>, the ability to write certain objects (e.g., numbers, polynomials) as a product of simpler objects (such as prime numbers). This is something you have likely been doing for several years, but we have generally taken it as an article of faith that this can be done in a unique way. The first three chapters of this work has the goal of uncovering structural conditions sufficient to guarantee something like the unique factorization into primes that we know and love from the integers. The fourth chapter is a coda that allows for a deeper exploration of our main objects of interest (rings), as well as functions that relate these objects to one another.</p>
