<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>Let \(R\) be a PID, and observe that by <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm-writeasprodofirred.html" title="Theorem 3.2.8">Theorem 3.2.8</a> every nonzero nonunit can be written as a product of irreducibles. We thus need only show that this product is unique (up to associates).</p>
<p>To that end, we adopt the notation of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def-ufd.html" title="Definition 3.2.1">Definition 3.2.1</a>. Let \(s\in R\text{.}\) We perform induction on the number of irreducible factors \(k\) of \(s\text{.}\) If \(k=0\text{,}\) then \(s\) is a unit. If we had \(s = pa\) for some irreducible \(p\text{,}\) then \(p\) divides a unit and would thus be a unit itself, which is a contradiction.</p>
<p>Suppose now that \(k\ge 1\) and we write</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
s = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_k \text{ and }  s = q_1 q_2 \cdots q_m, \ m \ge k,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">where the \(p_i\) and \(q_j\) are not necessarily distinct irreducibles. Since \(p_1 | q_1 q_2 \cdots q_m\text{,}\) we know by <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm-primesareirredinPID.html" title="Theorem 3.2.10">Theorem 3.2.10</a> that \(p_1\) must divide one of the factors.</p>
<p>Renumbering, we may assume that \(p_1 | q_1\text{,}\) whence \(q_1 = p_1 v_1\text{,}\) where \(v_1\) must be a unit as \(q_1\) is irreducible. Canceling \(p_1\) yields</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
p_2 p_3 \cdots p_k = v_1 q_2 q_3 \cdots q_n, m\ge k.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">By induction on \(k\) we conclude that each of the irreducible factors on the left matches with precisely one factor on the right (up to associates). This completes the inductive step, and thus the proof.</p></article></body>
