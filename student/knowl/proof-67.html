<p>Suppose \(2 = ab\text{.}\) Then \(4 = \delta(2) = \delta(a)\delta(b)\text{.}\) By the lemma, we may not have \(\delta(a) = 2\text{,}\) which means without loss of generality that \(\delta(a) = 1\text{,}\) and thus \(a\) is a unit. Therefore, 2 is irreducible.</p>
<p>Now suppose that \(1 + \sqrt{-7} = ab\text{.}\) Then \(8 = \delta(1+\sqrt{-7}) = \delta(a) \delta(b)\text{.}\) The possible values for \(\delta(a)\) are 1, 2, 4, and 8. If \(\delta(a) = 1\) or 8, then \(1+\sqrt{-7}\) is irreducible, as either \(a\) or \(b\) is necessarily a unit. By the lemma, we may not have \(\delta(a) = 2\) or \(\delta(b) = 2\text{,}\) so in fact either \(\delta(a) = 1\) or 8. Therefore, \(1\pm \sqrt{-7}\) is irreducible.</p>
<p>Since we have factored 8 into two different products of irreducibles, \(R\) is not a UFD.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="SubSec-Nonunique-Factorization.html#proof-67">in-context</a></span>
