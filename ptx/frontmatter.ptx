  <title>Introduction</title>
  <!-- 
<p>
    While it is difficult to intuitively define the way in which mathematics is structural,
    its concern with <em>number</em> is clear,
    especially for students of elementary mathematics such as arithmetic.
    However, the study of <em>number</em>
    rapidly leads one to structural questions regarding the properties of numbers themselves,
    which has historically been the domain of <em>algebra</em>.
  </p>

 <p>
 	Historically, algebra has been concerned with 
 </p>
 -->
 	


  <p>
    In<nbsp /><xref ref="franklin2014aristotelian" />,
    the author defines a <em>purely structural property</em> as one that
    <q>can be defined wholly in terms of the concepts same and different,
    and part and whole (along with purely logical concepts).</q>
    This definition and its reference to parts and wholes calls to mind the history of the word
    <em>algebra</em> itself,
    which comes from the Arabic <em>al-jabr</em>, literally meaning
    <q>the reunion of broken parts</q>.
    One of the concepts fundamental to the historical development of algebra is the notion of <em>factorization</em>;
    closely related questions that have driven the development of algebra over the centuries are:
    when does a polynomial equation have solutions in a particular number system,
    and is there a systematic way to find them?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The goal of this book is to explore the idea of factorization from an abstract perspective.

			In <xref ref="Sec-Integers" />, we develop our foundations in the integers. Much of this chapter will be familiar to students who have had a first course in number theory, but we are especially concerned with results that preview the structural questions we'll investigate in more abstract settings.
		</p>

		<p>
			In <xref ref="Sec-Fields-and-Rings" />, we begin the process that so defines modern mathematics: abstraction. We ask: from the point of view of algebra, what properties of the integers are really important? And then we study those. We find that they are also held by several other familiar collections of numbers and algebraic objects, and then study those objects in increasing depth.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<xref ref="Sec-Factorization" /> begins with an exploration of factorization properties of polynomials in particular. We then precisely describe what we mean by <q>unique factorization</q> before demonstrating that every Euclidean domain possesses the unique factorization property.
			We conclude with a brief exploration of the ways in which systems of numbers and polynomials can fail to possess the unique factorization property.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Finally, in <xref ref="Sec-Ideals" />, we explore the concept of ideals in general, and use them to build new rings and study properties of homomorphisms.
		</p>
		
		<p>
    Throughout this book, we will walk in the realms of abstraction,
    and catch glimpses of the beauty and incredible power of this perspective on mathematics.

	<title>A Note to Students</title>
		<p>
			Welcome! We are so glad you are here.
		</p>
		<p>
			This book was written in response to a bit of student feedback from one of the author's (Janssen) first time teaching his institution's introduction to abstract algebra. In short, the feedback was: <em>I am a future teacher, and I do not know why I had to take this course</em>.
			The criticism was fair; much of what we had covered that semester did not look like what one typically thinks of as <q>algebra</q>, yet it definitely was.
			In the intervening years, we set out to rethink the way we introduce students to this beautiful subject, and subsequently developed this free resource to do so.
		</p>
		
		
		
		<p>
			The focus of the first three chapters is <em>factorization</em>, the ability to write certain objects (e.g., numbers, polynomials) as a product of simpler objects (such as prime numbers). This is something you have likely been doing for several years, but we have generally taken it as an article of faith that this can be done in a unique way.
			The first three chapters of this work has the goal of uncovering structural conditions sufficient to guarantee something like the unique factorization into primes that we know and love from the integers.
			The fourth chapter is a coda that allows for a deeper exploration of our main objects of interest (rings), as well as functions that relate these objects to one another.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			This book was written with the belief that the best way to learn mathematics is to <em>do</em> mathematics.
			Thus, there are vanishingly few worked examples or proved theorems.
			Instead, you will provide the proofs and solutions to exercises.
			It is possible, if you look hard enough, to find some of the answers elsewhere on the internet.
			I implore you to resist the urge to do so.
			You will learn much more by struggling with a problem, even if you do not ultimately solve it, than you will by searching for an answer after a few minutes of toying with a problem.
			The rewards of your struggle will be deep and long-lasting.
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's begin.

  <title>A Note to Instructors</title>
  
  
  <p>
  	Welcome! Thank you for considering this text; it won't be for everyone, as strong opinions informed its creation.
    The strongest are (a) that students learn math best by doing it,
    and (b) that students<ndash/>especially pre-service teachers<ndash/>more naturally learn modern algebra by encountering rings first.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pedagogically, these notes fall under the big tent of
    <em>inquiry-based learning</em> (IBL).
    Broadly, there are several types of statements you'll find as you read these notes.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Theorems</em>: A <em>numbered</em>
          theorem is a statement that students are expected to prove for themselves.
          The authors generally assign 3<ndash/>6 numbered theorems
          (or exercises, or lemmas)
          for each class meeting,
          with students expected to present their work during the next class.
          These presentations and the ensuing discussions form the regular work of the class.
          Students are <em>not</em> expected to prove
          <em>unnumbered</em> theorems.
          The unnumbered theorems unify nearby numbered theorems
          (such as stating an existence theorem and uniqueness theorem as a single result),
          or are otherwise too technical or complicated to be illuminating.
          Nonetheless,
          they are generally important results of which students should be aware.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Lemmas</em>: There are a few lemmas in the notes.
          As a rule, these lemmas pull out a step from nearby theorems that might be too big to reasonably expect students to take by themselves.
          If you would like to suggest additional lemmas,
          feel free to get in touch with the authors.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Exercises</em>: The exercises are generally computational in nature,
          and presage an upcoming generalization (or reinforce a recent theorem). They are generally labeled as <em>Activity</em>, <em>Exploration</em>, or <em>Investigation</em>.
          As such, more than a correct numerical answer is needed for a good solution to an exercise.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Challenges</em>: There are a few (unnumbered) challenge problems in the text.
          These problems may be assigned or they may not,
          but they are generally difficult and their omission will not disrupt the flow of the text.
          Students may be interested merely in knowing their statements (e.g., <m>\Z[x]</m> is not a PID).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    We begin with a brief overview of some results from elementary number theory regarding divisibility and primes,
    and introduce modular arithmetic.
    Other than induction, no proof techniques are explicitly discussed.
    It is assumed that students using these notes have had an introduction to proofs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Brief attention is paid to fields before we dive in to rings.
    Other than mentioning their existence,
    no attention is given to noncommutative rings.
    Rings and ideals are developed with an eye toward eventually proving that every Euclidean domain is a unique factorization domain.
    We briefly explore nonunique factorization
    (though this could be done in outside homework, if desired)
    before turning to an exploration of homomorphisms and ideals in general.
  </p>
  <p>
    As of this writing (July 2020), groups are not covered in this book.
    Depending on personal preference,
    with the time left at the end of the semester
    (often approximately 1<ndash/>3 weeks,
    depending on your class's pace),
    you could present an introduction to groups directly to your students,
    or use freely available IBL material from the
    <url href="http://jiblm.org/"><em>Journal of Inquiry-Based Learning in Mathematics</em></url>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  	The book has been used to carry a full semester course several times at Dordt University, Morningside College, and Grand Valley State University
  	Future plans for the text include:
  	<ul>
  		<li>An expanded treatment of fields, with an emphasis on extensions of <m>\Q</m> (and possible introduction to groups via permutations of roots of polynomials).</li>
  		<li>Additional optional end-of-section exercises.</li>
  		<li>Integration of SageMath cells to aid computation where appropriate.</li>
  		<li><delete>PDF and HTML versions of both the student and instructor versions</delete>. These are available! Sort of. No HTML instructor version yet, but a <xref ref="Sec-Versions" text="custom">PDF of the student version</xref> is now available.</li>
  		<li><delete>Low-cost print copies of the student version</delete>. Coming soon!</li>
  	</ul>
	There is no planned timeline for any of these projects.
	If you are interested in helping make one of these happen, please email me (Mike) and let me know!
	Or, if you just want to let me know that you've found the text useful, that would also be welcome news.
	And of course, if you find any typos or mistakes, I would love to know that as well.
