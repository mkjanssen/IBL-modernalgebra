  <introduction>
    <p>
      As children we start exploring the properties and structure of the positive integers as soon as we learn to count and we extend our understanding throughout our schooling as we learn about new operations and collections of numbers.
      We begin our journey into abstract algebra with an overview of some familiar (and some possibly unfamiliar) properties of the integers that are relevant to our course of inquiry.
      With this foundation set, we will see in later chapters just how far we can extend these properties in more abstract setting.

    <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section we will assume the basic algebraic/arithmetic properties of the integers such as closure under addition, subtraction, and multiplication,
      most of which we will formalize via axioms in subsequent sections.
      <xref ref="axiom_wellordering" /> formalizes the familiar notion that nonempty subsets of the positive integers have a smallest element, which will be used repeatedly throughout the text.
      We then explore a closely related idea, mathematical induction, via an example and exercises.

              <idx><h>natural numbers</h></idx>
              <idx><h><m>\N</m></h></idx>
          The collection of <term>natural numbers</term> is denoted by <m>\N</m>, and is the set
          <me>
            \N = \set{1, 2, 3, \ldots}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          By <m>\N_0</m> we mean the set <m>\N\cup \set{0} = \set{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      In some sense,
      the fundamental properties of <m>\N</m> are (a) there is a smallest natural number,
      and (b) there is always a next natural number<footnote>In fact, one can build a model of <m>\N</m> with set theory and the Peano axioms, which utilize the notion of a
      <em>successor</em>--the next natural number.)
</footnote>.
		A consequence of the Peano postulates is the
      <em>well-ordering principle</em>, which we state as an axiom.
    </p>
    <axiom xml:id="axiom_wellordering">
      <title>Well-Ordering Principle</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
              <idx><h>Well-Ordering Principle</h></idx>
          Every nonempty subset of <m>\N_0</m> contains a least (smallest) element under the usual ordering, <m>\le</m><fn>
Our word choice is suggestive. In fact, other orderings do exist, and while the set of nonnegative real numbers <m>\mathbb{R}</m> does not satisfy the well-ordering principle under the usual ordering <m>\le</m>, the Well Ordering Axiom asserts that there exists a well ordering on <em>any</em> set, including <m>\mathbb{R}</m>. Accepting this axiom is equivalent to accepting the <url href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/axiom-choice/">axiom of choice</url>.
</fn>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </axiom>
    
    <p>
    		The Well-Ordering Principle is useful for producing smallest elements of nonempty subsets defined to have certain properties, as the following example demonstrates.

    				In this exploration, we investigate polynomials with real coefficients, as well as their degrees.
    				We will define these terms more formally in <xref ref="def-polynomial" />, but for now you may use your intuition from previous courses in algebra.
    			</p>
    			<p>
    				Let <m>S</m> be the set of all polynomials <m>f</m> in the variable <m>x</m> with real coefficients such that <m>f(2) = f(-2) = 0</m> and <m>f(0) = -4</m>.

			<ol>
				<li>Examples vary, but <m>f(x) = x^2-4</m> and <m>g(x) = x+1</m> suffice.</li>
				<li>Since <m>f(x) = x^2 - 4\in S</m>, we see that <m>2\in D</m>. Furthermore, the zero polynomial is not in <m>S</m>, so the degrees of polynomials in <m>S</m> are all nonnegative integers. Thus, <m>D\subseteq \N_0</m>.</li>
				<li>We see that <m>D</m> meets the conditions of the well-ordering principle, and so it has a least element. This least element is the degree of the polynomial of least degree satisfying <m>f(2) = f(-2) = 0</m> and <m>f(0) = -4</m>.</li>

    <p>
      Mathematical induction is like climbing an infinite staircase.
      The <em>base case</em> tells us that we can take a first step on the staircase
      (<m>k_0</m>).
      In the <em>inductive hypothesis</em>,
      we assume we can take all the steps up to a certain height
      (<m>n</m>).
      In the <em>inductive step</em>,
      we prove that this allows us to take the <m>(n+1)</m>st step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, if we can take step <m>k_0</m>, we can
      (by the inductive step)
      take step <m>k_0 + 1</m>.
      And since we can take step <m>k_0 + 1</m>, we can
      (again by the inductive step)
      take step <m>k_0 + 2</m>.
      And so on, forever
      (or, if the notion of actual infinity makes you uncomfortable,
      as far as we want to go).
    </p>
    <!-- 
<p>
      It can be proved that the principle of mathematical induction is logically equivalent to the well-ordering principle.
      That is, if we assume either one to be true, we can deduce the other.
      We will generally take the well-ordering principle on <m>\N</m> to be an axiom,
      and treat induction as a theorem.

    	<title>Example</title>
		<p>
     
      
          For all <m>n \ge 1</m>,
          <me>
            1+ 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
          </me>.
        
        </p>

        <p>
       
      <em>Proof.</em> Base case: When <m>n = 1</m>,
      the equation <m>1 = \frac{1\cdot (1+1)}{2}</m> is true.
    
    </p>
<p>
    
      <em>Inductive Hypothesis:</em> Assume that there exists a <m>n</m> such that whenever <m>k \le n</m>,
      the equation
      <men xml:id="ex_indhyp">
        1+ 2 + 3 + \cdots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
      </men>
      is true.
    </p>

<p>
    
      <em>Inductive Step:</em> Our goal is to show that <m>P(n+1)</m> is true.
      That is, we wish to establish that
      <men xml:id="ex_indgoal">
        1+ 2 + 3 + \cdots + n + (n+1) = \frac{(n+1)((n+1)+1)}{2}
      </men>.
    </p>

<p>
    
      We begin on the left-hand side of <xref ref="ex_indhyp" />,
      where we may apply the inductive hypothesis to see that
      <men xml:id="ex_indstep1">
        1+ 2 + 3 + \cdots + n + (n+1) = \left[\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right] + (n+1)
      </men>.
    
      Through the use of straightforward algebra,
      the right-hand side becomes
      <men xml:id="ex_indstep2">
        \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + \frac{2(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n(n+1) + 2(n+1)}{2} = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}
      </men>.
    </p>

<p>
    
      Putting <xref ref="ex_indstep1" /> and <xref ref="ex_indstep2" /> together,
      we obtain
      <me>
        1+ 2 + 3 + \cdots + n + (n+1) = \frac{(n+1)((n+1)+1)}{2}
      </me>,
      which is exactly the goal we stated in <xref ref="ex_indgoal" />.

    		<title>Divisibility and the Division Algorithm</title>
    <p>
      In this section,
      we begin to explore some of the arithmetic and algebraic properties of <m>\Z</m>. We focus specifically on the divisibility and factorization properties of the integers, as these are the main focus of the text as a whole.
      One of the primary goals of this section is to formalize definitions that you are likely already familiar with and of which you have an intuitive understanding.
      At first,
      this might seem to unnecessarily complicate matters. 
      However, it will become clear as we move forward that formal mathematical language and notation are necessary to extend these properties to a more abstract setting.
      We begin with a familiar notion.
    </p>
    <definition>

      <idx>divides (integers)</idx>
      <idx>factor (integers)</idx>
        <p>
          Let <m>a,b\in \Z</m>.
          We say that <m>a</m> <term>divides</term>
          <m>b</m>, and write <m>a\mid b</m>,
          if there is an integer <m>c</m> such that <m>ac = b</m>.
          In this case, say that <m>a</m> and <m>c</m> are <term>factors</term> of <m>b</m>.
          If no such <m>c\in \Z</m> exists, we write <m>a\nmid b</m>.

      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Note that the symbol <m>|</m> is a <em>verb</em>;
      it is therefore correct to say,
      e.g., <m>2|4</m>, as 2 <em>does</em> divide 4.
      However, it is an abuse of notation to say that <m>2\mid 4 = 2</m>.
      Instead, we likely mean <m>4\div 2 = 2</m> or <m>\frac{4}{2} = 2</m>

    <p>
      As we saw above,
      not all pairs of integers <m>a,b</m> satisfy <m>a\mid b</m> or <m>b\mid a</m>.
      However,
      <url href="http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/4/NBT/B/6/">our experience in elementary mathematics does apply:
      there is often something left over (a remainder)</url>.
      The following theorem formalizes this idea for <m>a,b\in \N</m>.
    </p>
    
    <theorem xml:id="thm_divalg">
      <title>The Division Algorithm for <m>\N</m></title>
      <idx>Division Algorithm (<m>\N</m>)</idx>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>a,b\in \N</m>.
          Then there exist unique integers <m>q,r</m> such that <m>a = bq + r</m>,
          where <m>0 \le r \lt b</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
      	<p>
      		There are two parts to this theorem. First, you must establish that <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> exist. This is best done via <xref ref="axiom_wellordering" />. If you're stuck on that, check the second hint.
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		Once you have established that <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> exist, show that they are unique but assuming <m>a = bq+r</m> and <m>a = bq' + r'</m>, where <m>r,r'</m> both satisfy the conditions of the theorem. Argue that <m>q = q'</m> and <m>r = r'</m>.
      	</p>
      </hint>
      <hint>
      	<p>
      		Let <m>S = \setof{a-bs}{s\in \N_0, a-bs\ge 0}</m>.
      	</p>

      </hint>

      <proof>
      <p>
        First, assume that <m>a \lt b</m>.
        Then <m>q = 0</m> and <m>r = a</m> are sufficient.
        If <m>a = b</m>, then <m>q = 1</m> and <m>r = 0</m> will work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, assume that <m>a > b</m>.
        Then the set <m>S = \setof{s\in\N}{a-bs \ge 0}</m> is nonempty, as <m>a-b\in S</m>.
        By <xref ref="axiom_wellordering" />, <m>S</m> has a least element, which we will call <m>r</m>.
        Let <m>q\in \N_0</m> be such that <m>r = a-bq</m>; then <m>a = bq + r</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To finish the proof,
        it is enough to show that this choice of <m>r</m> satisfies <m>0\le r \le b-1</m>.
        Observe that <m>r\in S</m>, so <m>r\ge 0</m>.
        If <m>r \ge b</m>, then <m>a - b(q+1) = a-bq -b = r -b \ge 0</m>.
        Since <m>q+1 > q</m>,
        this is a contradiction to the assumption that <m>q</m> was the largest element of <m>S</m>.
        Thus, <m>r \lt b</m>, i.e., <m>r \le b-1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>q,q',r,r'</m> be such that <m>a = bq+r</m> and <m>a=bq'+r'</m>.
        We see that <m>bq+r = bq' + r'</m>,
        so <m>b(q-q') = r'-r</m>, so <m>b|r'-r</m>.
        If <m>r'-r = 0</m>, we are done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, <m>r'-r</m> is a nonzero multiple of <m>n</m>.
        If <m>r' \ge r</m>,
        then <m>0\le b(q-q') = r' - r \le b-1 - r</m>, a contradiction.
        Similarly, if <m>r' \le r</m>,
        write <m>b(q'-q) = r-r' \ge 0</m>,
        and a symmetric argument leads to a contradiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, <m>r' = r</m>, so <m>b(q-q') = 0</m>,
        and since <m>b > 0</m>, <m>q - q'= 0</m>, i.e., <m>q = q'</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>

    		How did you answer the last question in <xref ref="act-gcdcomputations" />? If you are like the authors' classes, the answers probably varied, though you have referred at some point to a "prime" (<xref ref="def-primeinteger" text="custom">whatever those are</xref>), or possibly some other ad hoc method for finding the gcd.
    		Most such methods rely in some form on our ability to factor integers.

      We will return to this idea several times, even after we have left the familiar realm of the integers.

      <proof>
      
      	<p>
      		Consider the set <m>S = \setof{as+bt}{s,t\in\Z, \ as+bt \gt 0}</m>.
      		We first show that <m>S\ne \emptyset</m>.

		<p>      		
      		Suppose without loss of generality that <m>a\ne 0</m>, and consider <m>a \gt 0</m>; then <m>s=1, t = 0</m> is sufficient to guarantee <m>as+bt\in S</m>.
      		If <m>a \lt 0</m>, then <m>s = -1, t= 0</m> is sufficient.
      		Regardless, <m>S\ne \emptyset</m>, and by the Well-Ordering Principle, <m>S</m> has a least element, <m>d = ax+by</m>.
      		We claim <m>d = \gcd(a,b)</m>.
      	</p>
		
		<p>
			We first show that <m>d|a</m>
			Use the division algorithm to write <m>a = dq + r</m>, where <m>r \lt d</m>.
			We find <m>r = a - dq = a - (ax+by)q = a(1-xq) + by</m>, and if <m>r\gt 0</m>, <m>r\in S</m>, contradicting the status of <m>d</m> as the least element of <m>S</m>.
			Thus, <m>r = 0</m>, and <m>d|a</m>.
			By a symmetric proof, <m>d|b</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
      	Suppose then that <m>e</m> is a common divisor of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>; write <m>a = e k_1</m> and <m>b = e k_2</m>.
      	Then <m>d = ax + by = (ek_1)x + (ek_2)y = e(k_1x + k_2 y)</m>, whence <m>e|d</m>.
      	Therefore, <m>d = \gcd(a,b)</m>.

      As described in the <xref ref="Sec-Introduction" text="custom">Introduction</xref>,
      our main goal is to build a deep structural understanding of the notion of <em>factorization</em>.
      That is, splitting objects (e.g., numbers,
      polynomials, matrices) into products of other objects.
      One of the most familiar examples of this process involves factoring integers into products of primes.

    	This is almost certainly not the definition of prime that you are familiar with from your school days, which likely said something to the effect that a prime <m>p > 1</m> is a natural number only divisible by 1 and itself.
    	However, <xref ref="def-primeinteger" /> is often more useful than the usual definition.
    	And, as <xref ref="theorem_euclidslemma" /> demonstrates, the two notions are equivalent.

    <lemma xml:id="theorem_euclidslemma">
    	<title>Euclid's Lemma</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given any <m>p\in \N</m>, <m>p > 1</m>,
          <m>p</m> is prime if and only if whenever <m>m\in \N</m> divides <m>p</m>,
          either <m>m = p</m> or <m>m = 1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>p</m> be prime and suppose <m>m\in \N</m> divides <m>p</m>,
        so <m>p = mk</m> for some <m>k\in \N</m>.
        By definition, <m>p|m</m> or <m>p|k</m>.
        If <m>p|m</m>, then <m>pj = m</m>, so <m>p = pjk</m>,
        and <m>jk=1</m>, which means <m>j=k=1</m> and thus <m>m=p</m>.
        If <m>p|k</m>, then <m>pj=k</m>,
        so <m>p = mpj</m>, and <m>mj=1</m>, so <m>m = j = 1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, assume <m>p\in \N</m> has the property that whenever an integer <m>m</m> exists with <m>m|p</m>,
        then <m>m= p</m> or <m>m =1</m>.
        Suppose <m>p|ab</m>,
        so there exists a <m>k\in\N</m> such that <m>pk = ab</m>.
        Note that if <m>\gcd(a,p) = d > 1</m>,
        then <m>d|p</m>, and so <m>d = p</m>, and then <m>p|a</m>.
        If <m>\gcd(a,p) = 1</m>,
        then by B&#xe9;zout's Identity there are integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> such that <m>ax + py = 1</m>,
        so we may multiply by <m>b</m> to obtain <m>abx + pby = b</m>,

    <remark>
    		<p>
    			How does your definition treat the number 1? 
    			The primality of 1 has been the subject of much debate stretching back to the Greeks (most of whom did not consider 1 to be a number). 
    			Throughout history, mathematicians have at times viewed 1 as prime, and at other times, not prime.
    			The main argument for the non-primality of 1 is that if 1 were taken to be prime, we would need to word theorems like the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (below) in such a way that only prime factorizations not including 1 can be considered. For, if 1 is prime, we would have to consider, e.g., <m>6 = 2\cdot 3 = 1\cdot 2 \cdot 3 = 1\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 3</m> as three different factorizations of 6 into primes.
    		</p>
    		<p>
    			However, neither is 1 composite (your definition should rule this out in some way).
    			Instead, we call 1 a <term>unit</term>, which we'll explore more fully in <xref ref="def-unit" /> and the following; consequently, the opposite of "prime" is not "composite", but "not prime".

      that positive integers greater than 1 <em>can</em>
      be factored into products of primes,
      and that this factorization can happen in only one way.

          there exist primes <m>p_1, p_2, \ldots,
          p_m</m> and natural numbers <m>r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_m</m> such that
          <me>
            n = p_1^{r_1} p_2^{r_2} \cdots p_m^{r_m}

    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        It is enough to show that,
        if <m>n > 1</m>, we may write <m>n = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_k</m>,
        where the <m>p_i</m>'s are not necessarily distinct primes.
        Then we can collect the common primes and write them with exponent notation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that when <m>n = 2</m>, there is such an expression,
        so let <m>k > 2</m> be the least positive integer that fails to be expressed as above.
        We note that <m>k</m> cannot be prime,
        or it could be expressed as above.
        Thus, by Theorem 2.1, there is a prime <m>p</m> such that <m>k = p b</m>,
        where <m>1 \lt p, b \lt k</m>.
        Since <m>k</m> was the least positive integer that cannot be factored as a product of primes,
        <m>b</m> has a prime factorization.
        But then so does <m>k</m>, a contradiction.

        <p>
          Let <m>p</m> and <m>q_1, q_2,\ldots,
          q_n</m> all be primes and let <m>k</m> be a natural number such that <m>pk = q_1 q_2 \ldots q_n</m>.
          Then <m>p = q_i</m> for some <m>i</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We first state a claim that will be useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Claim 1:</em> If <m>p,q</m> are primes such that <m>p|q</m>,
        then <m>p = q</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Proof of Claim 1:</em> Since
        <m>p,
        q > 1</m> and both <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are prime,
        <m>p = q</m> by the definition of primality.
        <m>\checkmark</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now assume that <m>pk = q_1 q_2 \cdots q_n = (q_1 q_2 \cdots q_{n-1}) q_n</m>.
        If <m>p|q_n</m>, we're done by Claim 1.
        If not, the definition of a prime guarantees that <m>p| q_1 q_2 \cdots q_{n-1}</m>.
        If <m>p|q_{n-1}</m>, we're done by Claim 1.
        Otherwise, <m>p|q_1 q_2 \cdots q_{n-2}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Repeating this process,
        we see that either <m>p|q_i</m> for some <m>i > 2</m>,
        or <m>p|q_1 q_2</m>.
        Now the definition of a prime guarantees that <m>p|q_1</m> or <m>p|q_2</m>,
        in which case Claim 1 requires that <m>p = q_1</m> or <m>p = q_2</m>.

      <p>
        Without loss of generality,
        assume <m>p_1 \lt  p_2 \lt  \cdots \lt  p_m</m> and <m>q_1 \lt  q_2 \lt  \cdots \lt  q_s</m>.
        Given a <m>p_i</m>,
        we know that <m>p_i | q_1^{t_1} q_2^{t_2} \cdots q_s^{t_s}</m>,
        which implies that <m>p_i | q_j</m> for some <m>j</m> by Claim 2 in the proof of Lemma 2.8.
        Further, Lemma 2.8 implies that <m>p_i = q_j</m>, and similarly,
        given a <m>q_j</m>, <m>q_j = p_i</m> for some <m>i</m>.
        Thus, <m>m =s</m>,
        and by the ordering of the <m>p_i</m>'s and <m>q_j</m>'s, we have <m>p_i = q_j</m>,
        <m>i = 1, 2, \ldots, m</m>.
        Therefore,
        <me>
          n = p_1^{r_1} p_2^{r_2} \cdots p_m^{r_m} = p_1^{t_1} p_2^{t_2} \cdots p_m^{t_m}

      <p>
        Now, assume by way of contradiction,
        that <m>r_i \ne t_i</m> for some <m>i</m>.
        Without loss of generality, we may assume <m>r_i \lt  t_i</m>.
        Then <m>p_i^{t_i} | p_1^{r_1} p_2^{r_2} \cdots p_m^{r_m}</m>,
        which implies that
        <me>
          p_i^{t_i - r_i} | p_1^{r_1} p_2^{r_2} \cdots \hat{p}_i^{r_i} \cdots p_m^{r_m}

        from which <m>p_i | p_j</m> for some <m>j\ne i</m> by Lemma 2.8.

    		Our first major result is in hand: we can factor natural numbers <m>n > 2</m> uniquely as a product of primes.
    		Much of the rest of this book seeks to deduce a generalization of this result that relies on structural arithmetic properties enjoyed by <m>\Z</m> and similar objects.

    		The foundation for our exploration of abstract algebra is nearly complete. 
    		We need the basics of one more "number system" in order to appreciate the abstract approach developed in subsequent chapters.
    		To build that number system, a brief review of relations and equivalence relations is required.
    		Recall that given sets <m>S</m> and <m>T</m>, the Cartesian product of <m>S</m> with <m>T</m>, denoted <m>S\times T</m> ("<m>S</m> cross <m>T</m>"), is the set of all possible ordered pairs whose first element is from <m>S</m> and second element is from <m>T</m>. Symbolically,
    </p>
    <me>
    		S\times T = \setof{(s,t)}{s\in S, \ t\in T}.

          A <term>relation</term> <m>R</m> on <m>S</m> is a subset of <m>S\times S</m>.
          If <m>x,y\in S</m> such that <m>(x,y)\in R</m>,

    		The notion of a relation as presented above is extremely open-ended.
    		<em>Any</em> subset of ordered pairs of <m>S\times S</m> describes a relation on the set <m>S</m>.
    		Of course, some relations are more meaningful than others; the branch of mathematics known as <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_theory">order theory</url> studies <em>order</em> relations (such as the familiar <m>\lt</m>).
    		Our focus will be on <em>equivalence relations</em>, which isolate the important features of <m>=</m>.

          Given an integer <m>m > 1</m>,
          congruence modulo <m>m</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>\Z</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>a\in \Z</m>.
        Then <m>m|a-a</m>, so <m>a \equiv_m a</m>.
        Thus, <m>\equiv_m</m> is reflexive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>a,b\in \Z</m> such that <m>a\equiv_m b</m>.
        This means that <m>m|a-b</m>,
        so there is some <m>k\in \Z</m> such that <m>mk = a-b</m>.
        Then <m>m(-k) = b-a</m>, so <m>m|b-a</m> and <m>b \equiv_m a</m>.
        Thus, <m>\equiv_m</m> is symmetric.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, let <m>a,b,c\in \Z</m> such that
        <m>a\equiv_m b</m> and <m>b\equiv_m c</m>.
        Then <m>m|a-b</m> and <m>m|b-c</m>,
        so there are integers <m>k_1, k_2</m> such that
        <m>m k_1 = a-b</m> and <m>m k_2 = b-c</m>.
        Summing these equations yields <m>m(k_1 + k_2) = (a-b) + (b-c) = a-c</m>,
        so <m>m|a-c</m> and <m>a\equiv_m c</m>.

          Let <m>p\in \N</m> be prime and
          <m>\overline{a},\overline{b},\overline{c}\in \Z_p</m> such that <m>\overline{c}\ne \overline{0}</m>.
          Then
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                there is some <m>\overline{x}\in \Z_p</m> such that <m>\overline{c}\cdot \overline{x} = \overline{1}</m>; and,
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                if <m>\overline{a} \cdot\overline{c} = \overline{b}\cdot\overline{c}</m>,
                <m>\overline{a} = \overline{b}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        In <m>\Z_p</m>,
        every nonzero equivalence class is represented by an <m>x</m> for which <m>\gcd(x,p) = 1</m>.
