<chapter xml:id="Sec-Ideals">
  <title>Ideals and Homomorphisms</title>
  <introduction>
  	<p>
  		The first three chapters of this text tell the story of unique factorization.
  		The culmination is the result that any Euclidean domain is a unique factorization domain; that is, in an integral domain with a well-behaved division algorithm, a nonzero nonunit necessarily factors uniquely into irreducibles.
  		In order to expediently develop that result, we ignored many concepts that are otherwise interesting and useful in a first course in abstract algebra.
  		This chapter is a coda that seeks to fill in some of those gaps.
  	</p>
  		<p>In <xref ref="SubSec-Ideals-In-General" />, we expand on the <xref ref="def-ideal" text="custom">definition of ideal</xref> introduced in <xref ref="SubSec-Principal-Ideals" /> and explore non-principal ideals.
  		No math course is complete without a discussion of functions of some sort; we explore homomorphisms in <xref ref="SubSec-Homomorphisms" />
  		Finally, in <xref ref="SubSec-Quotient-Rings" />, we introduce prime and maximal ideals, as well as the notion of congruence modulo <m>I</m> and use ideals to build new rings from old. We conclude with an exploration and proof of the First Isomorphism Theorem.

      		In this section, we'll seek to answer the questions:
      		<ul>
      			<li>What operations can we perform on existing ideals to create new ideals?</li>
      			<li>How can we describe (non-principal) ideals in general?</li>

    <introduction>
	    	<p>
	    		Recall that one of the ways in which we understand a mathematical object is to study its relationship to other mathematical objects.
	    		In algebra, we learn about a ring by studying its relationship to other rings via functions (introduced in <xref ref="SubSec-Homomorphisms" />) and to its ideals, introduced in <xref ref="def-ideal" />.
	    	</p>
	    	
	    	<p>
	    		The notion of an ideal number was first introduced by Ernst Kummer in the middle of the nineteenth century.
	    		Kummer was studying the cyclotomic integers in connection to work on Fermat's Last Theorem and reciprocity laws in number theory, and discovered, to use our modern terminology, that these rings of cyclotomic integers were not UFDs.
	    		In particular, he found irreducible cyclotomic integers that were not prime.
	    		His work, which was finished by Richard Dedekind by 1871, was to define a new class of complex number, an <em>ideal number</em> for which unique factorization into prime ideal numbers held.
	    		A related notion was developed by Kronecker and Lasker, before the two concepts were unified by David Hilbert and Emmy Noether into the more general version which we stated in <xref ref="def-ideal" />.
	    	</p>
	    	
	    	<p>
	    		In this section, we explore ways of describing non-principal ideals.
	    		We also explore properties of ideals, as well as their connections to other fields of mathematics.

    </introduction>
    
    <p>
    		We first explore the behavior of ideals under the usual set-theoretic operations of intersection and union.

    <p>
      When we studied principal ideals, we were able to describe the principal ideal in terms of a single generating element.
      However, not every ideal is principal (see the <xref ref="challenge-nonprincideal">Challenge</xref>).
      Still, we would like a way to more precisely describe the elements of such ideals; we begin with <xref ref="def_idealgeneration" />.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def_idealgeneration">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring with identity,
          and let <m>S\subseteq R</m> be a subset.
          Then
          <men xml:id="eq_idealgeneratedbyset">
            \langle S \rangle := \bigcap\limits_{\substack{J\supseteq S\\\text{ \(J\) is an ideal } } } J
          </men>
          is called the <term>ideal generated by <m>S</m></term><idx>ideal generated by a set</idx>, and we call <m>S</m> the <term>generating set for the ideal</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
    	A consequence of <xref ref="def_idealgeneration" /> is the following theorem.
    </p>
	<theorem>
		<statement>
			Let <m>R</m> be a ring.
			Then <m>\ideal{\emptyset} = \set{0}</m>.
		</statement>
		<proof>
		<p>	
			Observe that for all ideals <m>J</m> in <m>R</m>, <m>\emptyset\subseteq J</m>.
			In particular, one of the ideals in the right-hand side of <xref ref="eq_idealgeneratedbyset" /> is the zero ideal.
			Since the zero ideal is a subset of all ideals, the theorem follows. 
		</p>
	</proof>
	</theorem>
	


    <p>
     	One way to interpret <xref ref="def_idealgeneration" /> is that <m>\ideal{S}</m> is the smallest ideal (with respect to subset inclusion) that contains <m>S</m>.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="theorem-smallestideal">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given a commutative ring <m>R</m> and a subset <m>S</m> of <m>R</m>,
          <m>\ideal{S}</m> is the smallest ideal containing <m>S</m> in the sense that, if <m>J</m> is any ideal of <m>R</m> containing <m>S</m>, <m>\ideal{S}\subseteq J</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>I</m> be any ideal containing <m>S</m>.
        Thus, <m>I</m> is one of the ideals on the right-hand side of <xref ref="eq_idealgeneratedbyset" />.
        Since <m>\ideal{S}</m> is formed by the intersection of <m>I</m> with other ideals,
        <m>\ideal{S}\subseteq I</m>.
      </p>
   	 </proof>
    </theorem>
    
    <p>
    		The concept elucidated by <xref ref="theorem-smallestideal" /> is helpful, but does not give us a handle on the structure of the elements of <m>\ideal{S}</m>.
     	Such a description is provided by <xref ref="thm_idealgeneratingset" />.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm_idealgeneratingset">

        <p>
          Given a commutative ring with identity <m>R</m> and a nonempty subset <m>S</m> of <m>R</m>:
          <ol>
          	<li>The set <m>I = \setof{r_1 s_1 + r_2 s_2 + \cdots + r_n s_n}{r_i\in R, \ s_j \in S,\ n\ge 1}</m> is an ideal of <m>R</m>;</li>

          Begin by showing that <m>I=\setof{r_1 s_1 + r_2 s_2 + \cdots + r_n s_n}{r_i\in R, \ s_j \in S,\ n\ge 1}</m> is an ideal containing <m>S</m>.
        </p>
      </hint>
 -->
    	<proof>

      <p>
        It is clear that <m>0\in I</m>,
        and that if <m>r\in R</m> and <m>x\in I</m>, <m>rx\in I</m>.
        Moreover, the sum of two <m>R</m>-linear combinations of elements of <m>S</m> is yet another <m>R</m>-linear combination of elements of <m>S</m>.
        Thus, <m>I</m> is an ideal.
        Further, if <m>s\in S</m>,
        <m>1\cdot s \in I</m>, so <m>S\subseteq I</m>.
        Therefore, <m>\ideal{S}\subseteq I</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now assume that <m>x\in I</m>.
        Then <m>x</m> has the form <m>x = r_1 s_1 + \cdots + r_n s_n</m>.
        Each <m>s_i \in S</m>, so each
        <m>r_i s_i \in J</m> if <m>J</m> is any ideal containing <m>S</m>.
        In particular, <m>r_i s_i \in \ideal{S}</m>,
        and thus the sum <m>x = \sum r_i s_i \in \ideal{S}</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    </theorem>
    
   <p>
   	In other words, the ideal <m>\ideal{S}</m> contains all possible finite <q><m>R</m>-linear combinations</q> of elements of <m>S</m>; that is, it contains all finite sums of products of ring elements with elements from <m>S</m>.

        the ideal <m>I</m> generated by <m>S</m> is denoted by <m>I = \ideal{s_1, s_2, \ldots,

    		<statement>
    			<p>
    				The ring <m>\Z[x]</m> is not a PID.

			<hint>
			  <p>
				Consider the ideal <m>I = \langle 2, x \rangle</m>.
			  </p>
			</hint>
    		</statement>
		<proof>
		  <p>
			Suppose that <m>I = \ideal{a(x)}</m>.
			Since <m>2\in I</m>,
			<m>2 = c(x) a(x)</m> for some <m>c(x)\in \Z[x]</m>,
			so <m>\deg c(x) = \deg a(x) = 0</m>,
			and thus <m>a(x) = a\in \Z</m>.
			We also have <m>x\in I</m>, so <m>x = b(x) a</m>,
			which implies that <m>\deg b(x) = 1</m>,
			so <m>b(x) = b_1 x + b_0</m> for some <m>b_1,b_0\in \Z</m>.
			Then <m>x = (b_1 x + b_0)a</m> implies <m>b_1 a = 1</m>.
			Thus, <m>a = 1</m> or <m>a = -1</m>.
			In either case,
			<m>a</m> is a unit in <m>\Z[x]</m> so <m>1\in I</m>.
			By <xref ref="thm_idealgeneratingset">Theorem</xref>,
			there are polynomials <m>p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]</m> such that <m>1 = 2p(x) + xq(x)</m>.
			If <m>p_0</m> is the constant term of <m>p(x)</m>,
			it follows that the constant term of <m>2p(x) + xq(x)</m> is
			<m>2p_0 = 1</m>, which is a contradiction.

			Thus, <m>I</m> is not principal.

    		Note that the set <m>S</m> in <xref ref="thm_idealgeneratingset" /> need not be finite. 
    		However, in many familiar rings, every ideal will have a finite generating set, as the next theorem demonstrates.

    				Let <m>R</m> be a ring.
    				If <m>R</m> is Noetherian<fn>Recall <xref ref="def-noetherian" />.</fn>, then every ideal <m>I</m> of <m>R</m> is finitely generated.

    					Consider an arbitrary ideal <m>I</m> and inductively build an ascending chain of finitely generated ideals contained in <m>I</m>.
    				</p>
    			</hint>
    		</statement>
		<proof>
			<p>
				Assume that <m>R</m> is Noetherian.
				Inductively build an ascending chain of ideals as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>Let <m>x_1 \in I</m> be arbitrary.</li>
					<li>For all <m>i\ge 2</m>, let <m>x_i \in I\setminus \ideal{x_1, \ldots, x_{i-1}}</m> be arbitrary.</li>

				We thus obtain an ascending chain of ideals
				<me>
					\ideal{x_1} \subseteq \ideal{x_1, x_2}\subseteq \ideal{x_1,x_2,x_3}\subseteq \cdots
				</me>
				which must stabilize at <m>\ideal{x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n}</m>.
				That is, at some point, <m>I\setminus \ideal{x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n} = \emptyset</m>, and since <m>\ideal{x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n}\subseteq I</m>, we have <m>I = \ideal{x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n}</m>.

		</proof>
    </theorem>
    
    <p>
    		In fact, we could have used the finite generation of ideals as the definition of Noetherian rings, as the two notions are equivalent.
    		First, a lemma.
    </p>
    
    <lemma xml:id="lemma-ascendingchainideal">

    <theorem>
    		<statement>
    			<p>
    				Let <m>R</m> be a ring such that every ideal of <m>R</m> is finitely generated.
    				Then <m>R</m> is Noetherian.

		<hint>
			<p>
				Argue that the ideal <m>I</m> defined in <xref ref="lemma-ascendingchainideal" /> is a finitely generated ideal of <m>R</m>, and use this to conclude that the ascending chain stabilizes.
			</p>
		</hint>
		<proof>
			<p>
				Following the hint and <xref ref="lemma-ascendingchainideal" />, we have <m>I = \ideal{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n}</m> while <m>I_j\subseteq I</m> for all <m>j</m>.
				Since <m>I = \bigcup\limits_{j=1}^\infty I_j</m>, for each <m>k, 1\le k \le n</m>, there is a <m>j_k</m> satisfying <m>x_k \in I_{j_k}</m>.
				What is more, we may rename <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n</m> so that <m>j_1 \le j_2 \le \ldots \le j_n</m> and thus
				<me>
					I_{j_1} \subseteq I_{j_2}\subseteq \cdots \subseteq I_{j_n}.
				</me>
				Observe that this means that <m>x_{j_k}\in I_{j_n}</m> for all <m>k</m>, so that <m>I = I_{j_n}</m>.
				Thus, the chain stabilizes, and <m>R</m> is Noetherian.

    		Central to modern mathematics is the notion of <em>function</em><fn>This section assumes a familiarity with the idea of function from a set-theoretic point of view, as well as the concepts of injective (one-to-one), surjective (onto), and bijective functions (one-to-one correspondences).</fn>.
    		Functions arise in all areas of mathematics, each subdiscipline concerned with certain types of functions.
    		In algebra, our concern is with <em>operation-preserving</em> functions, such as the linear transformations <m>L : V\to W</m> of vector spaces you have seen in a course in linear algebra.
    		Those linear transformations had the properties that <m>L(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}) = L(\mathbf{v})+L(\mathbf{u})</m> (addition is preserved) and <m>L(c\mathbf{u}) = c L(\mathbf{u})</m> (scalar multiplication is preserved).
    	</p>
    	
    	<p>
    	We find something similar at work in the study of homomorphisms of rings, which we define to be functions that preserve both addition and multiplication.

    		If the only rings that existed were polynomial rings, familiar systems of numbers like <m>\Z, \Q, \R, \C</m>, and matrix rings, there would still be enough to justify defining the concept of a ring and exploring its properties. 
    		However, these are not the only rings that exist.
    		In this section, we explore a way of building new rings from old by means of ideals.
    		To better understand these new rings, we will also define two new classes of ideals: prime ideals, and maximal ideals.
    		We end by briefly connecting these rings to a familiar problem from high school algebra.

      Observe that if <m>b-a \in I</m>,

    	As was the case in <m>\Z_m</m>, congruence modulo <m>I</m> is an equivalence relation.

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a ring and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
          Then congruence modulo <m>I</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>R</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        Since <m>0\in I</m>, <m>a-a \in I</m> for all <m>a</m>,
        so <m>a + I = a+I</m> and the relation is reflexive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, if <m>b-a \in I</m>,
        then <m>-1(b-a) = a-b \in I</m>,
        so the relation is symmetric.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>b-a \in I</m> and <m>c-b\in I</m>,
        then <m>(b-a) + (c-b) = c-a \in I</m>,
        so the relation is transitive.
      </p>
    </proof>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      The set of equivalence classes under this relation is denoted <m>R/I</m>.
      What is more, this is not merely a set of equivalence classes.
      As the next two theorems demonstrate, this set possesses two algebraic operations that extend naturally from those of <m>R</m>.

	<theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be commutative with identity and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
          Then <m>I</m> is prime if and only if <m>R/I</m> is an integral domain.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Begin by assuming that <m>I</m> is prime,
        and suppose <m>(a+I)(b+I) = 0+I = I</m>.
        Then <m>ab \in I</m>, and since <m>I</m> is prime,
        either <m>a\in I</m> or <m>b\in I</m>.
        Thus either <m>a+I = 0+I</m> or <m>b+I = 0+I</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now assume that <m>R/I</m> is a domain.
        Further, let <m>a,b\in R</m> be such that <m>(a+I)(b+I) = ab+I = 0+I</m>.
        Then <m>ab\in I</m>, and since <m>R/I</m> is a domain,
        <m>a+I = 0+I</m> or <m>b+I = 0+I</m>,
        i.e., <m>a\in I</m> or <m>b\in I</m>.
        Thus, <m>I</m> is prime.

    <p>
    		We now consider another important class of ideals: the maximal ideals.
    	</p>

	

    <definition>
    <idx>maximal ideal</idx>
    <idx>ideal (maximal)</idx>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be commutative with identity and let <m>M\subsetneq R</m> be a nonzero ideal.
          We say that <m>M</m> is a <term>maximal ideal</term>
          if no proper ideal of <m>R</m> properly contains <m>M</m>.
          That is, if <m>J</m> is an ideal satisfying <m>M\subseteq J\subseteq R</m>,
          either <m>J=M</m> or <m>J=R</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
    	In other words, an ideal <m>M\ne R</m> is maximal if no <q>larger</q> ideal (with respect to inclusion) properly contains it.
    	As we will see later, rings can have many maximal ideals.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is a fact that any ring <m>R</m> with <m>0_R\ne 1_R</m> has a maximal ideal.
      This follows from <em>Zorn's Lemma</em>;
      a rigorous exploration of Zorn's Lemma lies outside of the scope of this text,
      but suffice it to say that Zorn's Lemma is incredibly useful in all areas of algebra for proving existence theorems.
      For example,
      a proof that every vector space has a basis relies on Zorn's Lemma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rings with only one maximal ideal are said to be <em>local rings</em>,
      and are actively studied in modern research in commutative algebra
      (the study of commutative rings and their properties).
    </p>
    
    <p>
    	The next two results demonstrate that the maximality of <m>I</m> is precisely the condition that guarantees that <m>R/I</m> is a field.

          and set <m>J = \setof{xr+y}{r\in R, \ y\in M}</m>.
          Then: <m>J</m> is an ideal of <m>R</m>; <m>M\subsetneq J</m>;
          and thus there exist <m>r'\in R</m>,
          <m>y'\in M</m> such that <m>1 = xr'+y'</m>.

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be commutative with identity and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
          Then <m>I</m> is maximal if and only if <m>R/I</m> is a field.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          For the forward direction, apply the previous lemma to construct an inverse for <m>x+I</m> given any <m>x\in R\setminus I</m>.
        </p>
      </hint>
      <proof>
      <p>
        If <m>R/I</m> is a field,
        assume <m>J</m> is an ideal of <m>R</m> that properly contains <m>I</m>.
        Let <m>x\in J\setminus I</m>;
        then <m>x+I</m> is a nonzero element of <m>R/I</m>,
        and since <m>R/I</m> is a field,
        there is some <m>y+I</m> such that <m>(xy)+I = 1+I</m>.
        Since <m>x\in J</m>, <m>xy\in J</m>.
        As <m>1+I = (x+I)(y+I) = xy+I</m>,
        we have <m>1-xy\in I\subsetneq J</m>,
        and thus <m>1 = (1-xy)+xy \in J</m>, which means <m>J = R</m>.
        Thus, <m>I</m> is maximal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, suppose that <m>I</m> is maximal and let <m>x\in R\setminus I</m>.
        Apply the previous lemma to obtain
        <m>1 = xr' + y'</m>, where <m>y'\in I</m>.
        Then
        <me>
          1 + I = xs+y + I = xs + I = (x+I)(y+I).

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Every maximal ideal is prime.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        All fields are integral domains.
        Thus, if <m>I</m> is maximal,
        <m>R/I</m> is a field, thus a domain,
        and thus <m>I</m> is prime.

    		In general, the converse is not true (see the <xref ref="challenge-nonmaximal-prime" text="custom">Challenge</xref> below).

    <theorem xml:id="thm-pid-primes-are-maximal">

        <p>
          In a principal ideal domain, every prime ideal is maximal.

      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a PID and <m>\ideal{p}</m> a prime ideal.
        By previous work, <m>p</m> is prime.
        Suppose that <m>\ideal{p} \subseteq \ideal{m}</m>.
        Thus, <m>p\in \ideal{m}</m>, so <m>m|p</m>.
        That is, <m>p = mk</m>.
        Since <m>p</m> is prime and <m>R</m> is a domain, it is irreducible.
        Thus, either <m>m</m> or <m>k</m> is a unit.
        If <m>m</m> is a unit, then <m>\ideal{m} = R</m>.
        If <m>k</m> is a unit, then <m>m = k^{-1} p</m>,
        and thus <m>m\in \ideal{p}</m>,
        which means that <m>\ideal{m} = \ideal{p}</m>.
      </p>

        Thus, <m>\ideal{p}</m> is maximal.

    	<title>Homomorphisms and Quotient Rings</title>
    	
    	<p>
    		As quotient rings provide fertile soil for building new examples of rings, it should not surprise us to find that homomorphisms interact with quotient rings in interesting and useful ways.
    		Chief among them are the <em>isomorphism theorems</em>.
    		In this subsection, we focus primarily on the First Isomorphism Theorem.
    		
    	</p>
    	
    	<p>
    		We have seen that any homomorphism <m>\p : R\to S</m> gives rise to an ideal of <m>R</m>, namely <m>\ker\p</m>.
    		Our next theorem demonstrates that, given a commutative ring with identity <m>R</m>, every ideal is the kernel of some homomorphism defined on <m>R</m>.

          Let <m>R</m> be commutative with identity and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
          Define <m>\p: R\to R/I</m> by <m>\p(r) = r+I</m>.
          Then <m>\p</m> is a homomorphism with <m>\ker\p = I</m>.

    <p>
      In what follows,
      we work toward a proof of the First Isomorphism Theorem for Rings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout, let <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> be commutative rings with identity,
      and let <m>\p : R\to S</m> be a homomorphism.
      Recall that <m>\im \p = \setof{s\in S}{\p(r) = s\text{ for some } r\in R}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Define <m>f: R/\ker \p \to \im \p</m> by <m>f(r+\ker \p) = \p(r)</m>.

    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Using the notation from above,
          <m>f</m> is a well-defined function.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>r_1 + \ker\p = r_2 + \ker\p</m>.
        Then <m>r_2-r_1 \in \ker\p</m>,
        so <m>\p(r_2-r_1) = 0_S</m>, and thus <m>\p(r_1) = \p(r_2)</m>.
        Therefore, <m>f(r_1+\ker\p) = f(r_2+\ker\p)</m>,
        and <m>f</m> is well-defined.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Using the notation above, <m>f</m> is a homomorphism.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We show that <m>f</m> preserves addition.
        That it preserves multiplication will follow similarly.
        Observe that <m>f((x+\ker\p) + (y+\ker\p)) = f((x+y)+\ker\p) = \p(x+y) = \p(x)+\p(y) = f(x+\ker\p) + f(y+\ker\p)</m>.

          Using the notation above, <m>f</m> is one-to-one.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>f(r_1 + \ker\p) = f(r_2 + \ker\p)</m>.
        That is, <m>\p(r_1) = \p(r_2)</m>.
        Then <m>\p(r_1 - r_2) = 0_S</m>,
        so <m>r_1 -r_2 \in \ker\p</m>,
        and therefore <m>r_1 + \ker\p = r_2 + \ker \p</m>.
        Thus, <m>f</m> is one-to-one.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Using the notation above, <m>f</m> is onto.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Since <m>\p</m> is onto <m>\im \p</m> by definition,
        given any <m>s\in \im \p</m> there is some <m>r\in R</m> such that <m>\p(r) = s</m>.
        Then <m>f(r+\ker\p) = \p(r)</m>.

        <p>
          In particular,

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\Z/\ideal{m} \cong \Z_m</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\Q[x]/\ideal{x-5} \cong \Q</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\R[x]/\ideal{x^2+1} \cong \C</m>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

    <proof>
    TBD
      <p>
        Define <m>\p: \R[x] \to \C</m> by <m>\p(p(x)) = p(i)</m>.
        We saw earlier that this evaluation map is a homomorphism.
        It is easy to see that <m>\p</m> is onto as
        <m>\p(a+bx) = a+bi</m> for any <m>a,b\in \R</m>.
        Thus, <m>\R[x]/\ker\p \cong \C</m> by the First Isomorphism Theorem.
      </p>
      <p>
        We claim that <m>\ker\p = \ideal{x^2+1}</m>.
        Clearly, <m>\ideal{x^2+1} \subseteq \ker\p</m>.
        Moreover, <m>\ker\p \subsetneq \R[x]</m>.
        Finally, <m>\ideal{x^2+1}</m> is prime and thus maximal,
        as <m>\R[x]</m> is a PID. Thus,
        <m>\ker\p = \ideal{x^2+1}</m>.
      </p>

    		<statement>
    			<p>
    				Let <m>R = \Z_6</m> and define <m>\p : \Z_6 \to \Z_2</m> by <m>\p(\overline{x}) = \overline{x}</m>.
    				That is, <m>\p</m> sends an equivalence class <m>\overline{x}\in \Z_6</m> represented by <m>x\in \Z</m> to the equivalence class represented by <m>x</m> in <m>\Z_2</m>.
