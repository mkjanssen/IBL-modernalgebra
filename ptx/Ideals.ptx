          Let <m>R</m> be commutative with identity and let
          <m>\set{I_{\alpha}}_{\alpha\in \Gamma}</m> be a family of ideals.
          Then <m>I = \bigcap\limits_{\alpha\in \Gamma} I_\alpha</m> is an ideal.

    <proof>
      <p>
        It is clear that <m>0\in I</m>.
        Moreover, if <m>x,y\in I</m>,
        then <m>x,y\in I_\alpha</m> for all <m>\alpha</m>,
        so <m>x-y\in I_\alpha</m> and thus <m>x-y\in I</m>.
        Finally, if <m>x\in I</m> and <m>r\in R</m>,
        <m>rx\in I_\alpha</m> for all <m>\alpha</m>, and thus <m>rx\in I</m>.

    	A consequence of <xref ref="def_idealgeneration" /> is the following theorem.

		<statement>
			Let <m>R</m> be a ring.

	<proof>
		<p>	
			Observe that for all ideals <m>J</m> in <m>R</m>, <m>\emptyset\subseteq J</m>.
			In particular, one of the ideals in the right-hand side of <xref ref="eq_idealgeneratedbyset" /> is the zero ideal.

      One way to think of <m>\ideal{S}</m> is given in the following theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given a commutative ring <m>R</m> and a subset <m>S</m> of <m>R</m>,
          <m>\ideal{S}</m> is the smallest ideal containing <m>S</m> in the sense that, if <m>J</m> is any ideal of <m>R</m> containing <m>S</m>, <m>\ideal{S}\subseteq J</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>I</m> be any ideal containing <m>S</m>.
        Thus, <m>I</m> is one of the ideals on the right-hand side of <xref ref="eq_idealgeneratedbyset" />.
        Since <m>\ideal{S}</m> is formed by the intersection of <m>I</m> with other ideals,
        <m>\ideal{S}\subseteq I</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
    	Another (often more useful) way to think about <m>\ideal{S}</m> follows.

        <p>
          Given a commutative ring with identity <m>R</m> and a nonempty subset <m>S</m> of <m>R</m>:

 -->
    </theorem>
    <proof>

      <p>
        It is clear that <m>0\in I</m>,
        and that if <m>r\in R</m> and <m>x\in I</m>, <m>rx\in I</m>.
        Moreover, the sum of two <m>R</m>-linear combinations of elements of <m>S</m> is yet another <m>R</m>-linear combination of elements of <m>S</m>.
        Thus, <m>I</m> is an ideal.
        Further, if <m>s\in S</m>,
        <m>1\cdot s \in I</m>, so <m>S\subseteq I</m>.
        Therefore, <m>\ideal{S}\subseteq I</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now assume that <m>x\in I</m>.
        Then <m>x</m> has the form <m>x = r_1 s_1 + \cdots + r_n s_n</m>.
        Each <m>s_i \in S</m>, so each
        <m>r_i s_i \in J</m> if <m>J</m> is any ideal containing <m>S</m>.
        In particular, <m>r_i s_i \in \ideal{S}</m>,
        and thus the sum <m>x = \sum r_i s_i \in \ideal{S}</m>.

        Consider the ideal <m>I = \langle 2, x \rangle</m>.
      </p>
    </hint>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>I = \ideal{a(x)}</m>.
        Since <m>2\in I</m>,
        <m>2 = c(x) a(x)</m> for some <m>c(x)\in \Z[x]</m>,
        so <m>\deg c(x) = \deg a(x) = 0</m>,
        and thus <m>a(x) = a\in \Z</m>.
        We also have <m>x\in I</m>, so <m>x = b(x) a</m>,
        which implies that <m>\deg b(x) = 1</m>,
        so <m>b(x) = b_1 x + b_0</m> for some <m>b_1,b_0\in \Z</m>.
        Then <m>x = (b_1 x + b_0)a</m> implies <m>b_1 a = 1</m>.
        Thus, <m>a = 1</m> or <m>a = -1</m>.
        In either case,
        <m>a</m> is a unit in <m>\Z[x]</m> so <m>1\in I</m>.
        By <xref ref="thm_idealgeneratingset">Theorem</xref>,
        there are polynomials <m>p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]</m> such that <m>1 = 2p(x) + xq(x)</m>.
        If <m>p_0</m> is the constant term of <m>p(x)</m>,
        it follows that the constant term of <m>2p(x) + xq(x)</m> is
        <m>2p_0 = 1</m>, which is a contradiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, <m>I</m> is not principal.

        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a ring and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
          Then congruence modulo <m>I</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>R</m>.
        </p>

    </theorem>
    <p>
      The set of equivalence classes under this relation is denoted <m>R/I</m>.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Since <m>0\in I</m>, <m>a-a \in I</m> for all <m>a</m>,
        so <m>a + I = a+I</m> and the relation is reflexive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, if <m>b-a \in I</m>,
        then <m>-1(b-a) = a-b \in I</m>,
        so the relation is symmetric.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>b-a \in I</m> and <m>c-b\in I</m>,
        then <m>(b-a) + (c-b) = c-a \in I</m>,
        so the relation is transitive.

          <m>a+I = b+I</m> and <m>c+I = d+I</m>,

        Write <m>b = x+a</m> and <m>d = c+y</m>.
        Then <m>bd = (x+a)(c+y) = xc + xy + ac + ay = ac + \underbrace{(xc+xy+ay)}_{\in I}</m>,

      It is a fact that any ring <m>R</m> with <m>0_R\ne 1_R</m> has a maximal ideal.
      This follows from <em>Zorn's Lemma</em>;
      a rigorous exploration of Zorn's Lemma lies outside of the scope of these notes,
      but suffice it to say that Zorn's Lemma is incredibly useful in all areas of algebra for proving existence theorems.
      For example,
      a proof that every vector space has a basis relies on Zorn's Lemma.

      Rings with only one maximal ideal are said to be <em>local rings</em>,

        Then <m>ab \in I</m>, and since <m>I</m> is prime,
        either <m>a\in I</m> or <m>b\in I</m>.
        Thus either <m>a+I = 0+I</m> or <m>b+I = 0+I</m>.

      <p>
        Now assume that <m>R/I</m> is a domain.
        Further, let <m>a,b\in R</m> be such that <m>(a+I)(b+I) = ab+I = 0+I</m>.
        Then <m>ab\in I</m>, and since <m>R/I</m> is a domain,
        <m>a+I = 0+I</m> or <m>b+I = 0+I</m>,
        i.e., <m>a\in I</m> or <m>b\in I</m>.
        Thus, <m>I</m> is prime.

          For the forward direction, apply the previous lemma.

    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        If <m>R/I</m> is a field,
        assume <m>J</m> is an ideal of <m>R</m> that properly contains <m>I</m>.
        Let <m>x\in J\setminus I</m>;
        then <m>x+I</m> is a nonzero element of <m>R/I</m>,
        and since <m>R/I</m> is a field,
        there is some <m>y+I</m> such that <m>(xy)+I = 1+I</m>.
        Since <m>x\in J</m>, <m>xy\in J</m>.
        As <m>1+I = (x+I)(y+I) = xy+I</m>,
        we have <m>1-xy\in I\subsetneq J</m>,
        and thus <m>1 = (1-xy)+xy \in J</m>, which means <m>J = R</m>.
        Thus, <m>I</m> is maximal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, suppose that <m>I</m> is maximal and let <m>x\in R\setminus I</m>.
        Apply the previous lemma to obtain
        <m>1 = xr' + y'</m>, where <m>y'\in I</m>.
        Then
        <me>
          1 + I = xs+y + I = xs + I = (x+I)(y+I)

      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        All fields are integral domains.
        Thus, if <m>I</m> is maximal,
        <m>R/I</m> is a field, thus a domain,
        and thus <m>I</m> is prime.

        <p>
          In a principal ideal domain, every prime ideal is maximal.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a PID and <m>\ideal{p}</m> a prime ideal.
        By previous work, <m>p</m> is prime.
        Suppose that <m>\ideal{p} \subseteq \ideal{m}</m>.
        Thus, <m>p\in \ideal{m}</m>, so <m>m|p</m>.
        That is, <m>p = mk</m>.
        Since <m>p</m> is prime and <m>R</m> is a domain, it is irreducible.
        Thus, either <m>m</m> or <m>k</m> is a unit.
        If <m>m</m> is a unit, then <m>\ideal{m} = R</m>.
        If <m>k</m> is a unit, then <m>m = k^{-1} p</m>,
        and thus <m>m\in \ideal{p}</m>,
        which means that <m>\ideal{m} = \ideal{p}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, <m>\ideal{p}</m> is maximal.

      Throughout, let <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> be commutative rings with identity,

      <p>
        We show that <m>f</m> preserves addition.
        That it preserves multiplication will follow similarly.
        Observe that <m>f((x+\ker\p) + (y+\ker\p)) = f((x+y)+\ker\p) = \p(x+y) = \p(x)+\p(y) = f(x+\ker\p) + f(y+\ker\p)</m>.

        Then <m>\p(r_1 - r_2) = 0_S</m>,
        so <m>r_1 -r_2 \in \ker\p</m>,
        and therefore <m>r_1 + \ker\p = r_2 + \ker \p</m>.

        Define <m>\p: \R[x] \to \C</m> by <m>\p(p(x)) = p(i)</m>.
        We saw earlier that this evaluation map is a homomorphism.
        It is easy to see that <m>\p</m> is onto as
        <m>\p(a+bx) = a+bi</m> for any <m>a,b\in \R</m>.
        Thus, <m>\R[x]/\ker\p \cong \C</m>.

      <p>
        We claim that <m>\ker\p = \ideal{x^2+1}</m>.
        Clearly, <m>\ideal{x^2+1} \subseteq \ker\p</m>.
        Moreover, <m>\ker\p \subsetneq \R[x]</m>.
        Finally, <m>\ideal{x^2+1}</m> is prime and thus maximal,
        as <m>\R[x]</m> is a PID. Thus,
        <m>\ker\p = \ideal{x^2+1}</m>.
