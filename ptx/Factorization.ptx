  <introduction>
  	<p>
  		In this chapter, we come to the heart of the text: a structural investigation of unique factorization in the familiar contexts of <m>\Z</m> and <m>F[x]</m>.
  		In <xref ref="SubSec-Factoring-Polynomials" />, we explore theorems that formalize much of our understanding of that quintessential high school algebra problem: factoring polynomials.
  		As we saw in <xref ref="thm_divalg" /> and <xref ref="theorem_polydivalg" />, both <m>\Z</m> and <m>F[x]</m> have a division algorithm and, thus, are Euclidean domains.
  		In <xref ref="SubSec-Factorization-in-Euclidean-Domains" />, we explore the implications for multiplication in Euclidean domains. That is: given that we have a well-behaved division algorithm in an integral domain, what can we say about the factorization properties of the domain?
  		
  	</p>
  	
  	<p>
  		Finally, in the optional <xref ref="SubSec-Nonunique-Factorization" />, we explore contexts in which unique factorization into products of irreducibles need not hold.

      		<statement>
      		In this section, we'll seek to answer the questions:
      		<ul>
      			<li>What properties of divisibility in <m>\Z</m> extend to <m>F[x]</m>?</li>
      			<li>What is an irreducible polynomial? Are there any tools we can use to determine if a given polynomial is irreducible?</li>
      		</ul>

    <p>
      One of the most beautiful consequences of an abstract study of algebra is the fact that both <m>\Z</m> and <m>F[x]</m> are Euclidean domains.
      While they are not
      <q>the same</q>,
      we can expect them to share many of the same properties.
      In this section,
      our first goal will be to extend familiar properties from <m>\Z</m> to <m>F[x]</m>.
      We will also see that particular features of a polynomial (e.g., its degree, or the existence of roots) allows for additional criteria for its irreducibility to be decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since both <m>\Z</m> and <m>F[x]</m> have a division algorithm,
      it is reasonable
      to expect that, similar to the integers, we can also investigate the greatest common divisor of polynomials.
      In fact, <xref ref="invest-euclid-alg-integers" text="custom">our method</xref> for finding the greatest common divisor of two integers extends nicely to polynomials.

          Then there exist polynomials
          <m>s(x),
          t(x)\in F[x]</m> such that <m>f(x) s(x) + g(x) t(x) = \gcd(f(x),g(x))</m>.

    		One of the most useful things we can do with polynomials is <em>evaluate</em> them by <q>plugging in</q> elements from our coefficient set (or some superset that contains it) and performing the resulting arithmetic in an appropriate ring.
    		We can make this completely rigorous using the language of functions: given a commutative ring <m>R</m> and all polynomials <m>p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n \in R[x]</m>, we define the function <m>p_f : R\to R</m> by <m>p_f(r) = a_0 + a_1 r + \cdots + a_n r^n </m>.
    		However, we will not belabor this point; instead, we will generally write <m>p(r)</m> in place of <m>p_f(r)</m> and appeal to our common notions of evaluating polynomials.
    	</p>
    	
    	<p>
    		Given a polynomial <m>p(x)\in R[x]</m>, we have frequently been interested in finding all <m>r\in R</m> for which <m>p(r) = 0</m>.

    	To simplify matters, we will focus henceforth on polynomials with coefficients in a field.
      The following theorem is
      <url href="http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSA/APR/B/2/">a result that you learned in high school algebra</url>
      (and have likely used countless times since then),
      but as with the other familiar topics we have explored so far,
      it is necessary to formalize prior to continuing.

    <theorem>
    <title>Factor Theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>F</m> be a field, and <m>p(x)\in F[x]</m>.
          Then <m>\alpha\in F</m> is a root of <m>p(x)</m> if and only if <m>x-\alpha</m> divides <m>p(x)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        If <m>x-\alpha</m> divides <m>p(x)</m>,
        then <m>p(x) = q(x) (x-\alpha)</m> and <m>p(\alpha) = q(\alpha) (\alpha - \alpha) = 0</m>,
        so <m>\alpha</m> is a root.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, use the division algorithm to divide <m>p(x)</m> by <m>x-\alpha</m>.
        Then <m>p(x) = q(x)(x-\alpha) + r</m>,
        where <m>\deg r \lt \deg (x-\alpha) = 1</m>.
        Thus, <m>r</m> is a nonzero constant.
        If <m>\alpha</m> is a root of <m>p</m>,
        then <m>0 = p(\alpha) = q(\alpha) (\alpha - \alpha) + r = 0 + r = r</m>,
        so <m>r=0</m> and <m>x-\alpha | p(x)</m>.

    		Note that while <m>F[x]</m> is a ring, and we already have a <xref ref="def_irreducibleelement" text="custom">definition</xref> of an irreducible element of a ring, we will find it useful to have a ready definition of irreducible in the context of polynomials with coefficients in a field.

          Every polynomial of degree 1 in <m>F[x]</m> is irreducible.

        Let <m>f(x)</m> be degree 1 and write <m>f(x) = s(x) t(x)</m>.
        Then <m>\deg f = 1 = \deg s + \deg t</m>.

        <p>
          A nonconstant polynomial <m>f(x)\in F[x]</m> of degree 2 or 3 is irreducible over <m>F</m> if and only if it has no zeros in <m>F</m>.

      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        We prove the double contrapositive:
        <m>f(x)\in F[x]</m> of degree 2 or 3 is reducible if and only if it has a zero in <m>F</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>f(x)</m> is reducible there exist nonconstant
        <m>s(x),t(x)\in F[x]</m> such that <m>f(x) = s(x) t(x)</m>.
        Since <m>\deg f = 2</m> or 3, one of <m>s(x)</m> or <m>t(x)</m> has degree 1, and is thus of the form <m>x-\alpha</m>,
        where <m>\alpha \in F</m>.
        Thus, <m>f</m> has a zero.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, if <m>f</m> has a zero <m>\alpha\in F</m>,
        <m>f(x) = (x-\alpha)g(x)</m>,
        where <m>\deg g \ge 1</m>.
        Thus, <m>f</m> is reducible over <m>F</m>.

        Multiplying by <m>g(x)</m> yields

    We next state the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.
    Despite its name, its proof relies on analytic properties of the real numbers; there is no purely algebraic proof.

    	Thus, the multiplicative structure of <m>\C[x]</m> is straightforward: everything can be factored as a product of linear polynomials.
    	Fields of coefficients like <m>\C</m> for which this is true are said to be <term>algebraically closed</term>; not all fields satisfy this property.
    	For instance, <m>x^2 + 1\in \R[x]</m> does not factor into a product of linear polynomials. Consequently, <m>\R</m> is not algebraically closed.

	<p>
		However, regardless of whether our field is algebraically closed, we have not yet determined that any <m>p\in F[x]</m> can be factored uniquely into a product of irreducibles, or even that such factorizations into irreducibles exist.

      We now set our sights on a proof of <xref ref="theorem_everyedisufd" />.

    	<title>Euclidean Domains are UFDs</title>

    
    <p>
    	We now begin collecting results to prove that every Euclidean domain is a UFD.
    	The first condition in the UFD definition is that every nonzero nonunit factors as a product of irreducibles.
    	We first show that every nonzero nonunit is divisible by at least one irreducible (<xref ref="lem_divisiblebyirred" />), which we apply to show that every nonzero nonunit can be written as a finite product of irreducibles (<xref ref="thm-writeasprodofirred" />).
    	</p>


    
    <lemma xml:id="lem_divisiblebyirred">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a principal ideal domain,
          and <m>r\in R</m> a nonzero nonunit.
          Then <m>r</m> is divisible by an irreducible.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          Let <m>r\in R</m> be reducible and write <m>r = r_1 r_2</m>.
          Continue to factor reducibles and build an ascending chain of ideals.
        </p>
      </hint>
      <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>r</m> is not irreducible.
        Write <m>r = r_1 r_2</m>, where the <m>r_i</m> are nonzero nonunits.
        Then <m>\ideal{r} \subsetneq \ideal{r_1}</m>.
        If <m>r_1</m> is not irreducible,
        we may write <m>r_1 = r_{1,1}r_{1,2}</m>,
        where <m>r_{1,1},r_{1,2}</m> are nonzero nonunits, and observe that
        <me>
          \ideal{r} \subsetneq \ideal{r_1}\subsetneq \ideal{r_{1,1}}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        (If <m>r_1</m> <em>is</em> irreducible and we nonetheless write <m>r_1 = r_{1,1} r_{1,2}</m>,
        then either <m>\ideal{r_{1,1}} = R</m> if <m>r_{1,1}</m> is a unit,
        or <m>\ideal{r_{1,1}} = \ideal{r_1}</m> if <m>r_{1,1}</m> is associate to <m>r_1</m>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Continuing in this way,
        we may continue to factor the reducible factors of <m>r_1</m>;
        since <m>R</m> is a PID and thus has the ascending chain condition,
        we must eventually reach a point where the chain stabilizes,
        i.e., that we have found an irreducible factor of <m>r_1</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    </lemma>
    
    <theorem xml:id="thm-writeasprodofirred">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a PID. Then every nonzero nonunit element of <m>R</m> is either irreducible or can be written as a finite product of irreducibles in <m>R</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        We may perform the analysis from <xref ref="lem_divisiblebyirred">Lemma</xref> for all factors of <m>r</m>,
        and thus <m>r</m> can be factored into a product of irreducibles.
      </p>
    </proof>
    </theorem>
    
    <p>
    	The second condition that must be satisfied for a domain to be a UFD is that the product of irreducibles must be unique (up to associates).
    	In order to prove that, we will make use of <xref ref="thm-primesareirredinPID" />, which states that in PIDs, primes and irreducibles are identical concepts.

        Since <m>R</m> is a PID, <m>I = \ideal{\gcd(a,p)} = \ideal{1}</m>.

      <p>
        Assume that <m>p</m> is prime.
        Suppose that <m>p=ab</m> for some <m>a,b \in R</m>.
        Then <m>p</m> divides <m>ab</m> which implies that <m>p</m> divides <m>a</m> or <m>p</m> divides <m>b</m>.
        WLOG, assume that <m>p</m> divides <m>a</m>.
        Then there exists <m>c\in R</m> such that <m>a=pc</m> which implies that <m>p=pcb</m>.
        Therefore <m>cb=1</m> and <m>b</m> is a unit which implies that <m>p</m> is irreducible.

        Assume that <m>p</m> is irreducible.

        Then <m>\ideal{a,p}=R</m> and there exists
        <m>x,y\in R</m> such that <m>1=ax+py</m>.
        Multiplying boths sides by <m>b</m> yiels
        <m>b=abx+pby=p(cx+by)</m> which implies that <m>p</m> divides <m>b</m> and therefore <m>p</m> is prime.

      		Let <m>R</m> be a PID, and observe that by <xref ref="thm-writeasprodofirred" /> every nonzero nonunit can be written as a product of irreducibles.
      		We thus need only show that this product is unique (up to associates).
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		To that end, we adopt the notation of <xref ref="def-ufd" />.
      		Let <m>s\in R</m>.
      		We perform induction on the number of irreducible factors <m>k</m> of <m>s</m>.

            where the <m>p_i</m> and <m>q_j</m> are not necessarily distinct irreducibles.
            Since <m>p_1 | q_1 q_2 \cdots q_m</m>, we know by <xref ref="thm-primesareirredinPID" /> that <m>p_1</m> must divide one of the factors.
			</p>
			<p>
				Renumbering, we may assume that <m>p_1 | q_1</m>, whence <m>q_1 = p_1 v_1</m>, where <m>v_1</m> must be a unit as <m>q_1</m> is irreducible.
				Canceling <m>p_1</m> yields
				<me>
					p_2 p_3 \cdots p_k = v_1 q_2 q_3 \cdots q_n, m\ge k.

			By induction on <m>k</m> we conclude that each of the irreducible factors on the left matches with precisely one factor on the right (up to associates).

 <!-- 
     <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a PID and suppose that a non-zero non-unit element <m>a\in R</m> can be factored in two different ways as a product of irreducibles.
        <me>
          a=p_1p_2\cdots p_r=q_1q_2\cdots q_s
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Assume that <m>s\geq r</m>.
        Since <m>p_1</m> is irreducible
        (and therefore prime),
        there exists <m>j</m> such that <m>p_1 \mid q_j</m>, so <m>q_j = p_1 v_1</m>.
        Since <m>q_j</m> and <m>p_1</m> are irreducible,
        there is a unit <m>u_1 = v_1^{-1}</m> such that <m>p_1=u_1 q_j</m>.
        Up to reordering we have
        <me>
          p_1p_2\cdots p_r=u_1p_1q_2\cdots q_s

      which says that there are no nontrivial integer solutions <m>(x,y,z)</m> to the equation <m>x^n + y^n = z^n</m> if <m>n \ge 3</m>.
      Pierre de Fermat famously claimed that he had a <q>marvelous proof</q> of this fact, but the margin of the book in which he was writing was <q>too narrow to contain it.</q>
      Fermat's supposed proof was never found, and many now doubt that he had one.
      The search for a valid proof would not be complete until the work of Andrew Wiles and Richard Taylor in the mid-1990s.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1847, Gabriel Lam&#xe9; claimed he had completely solved the problem.
      His solution relied on the factorization of <m>x^p + y^p</m>,
      where <m>p</m> is an odd prime, as
      <me>
        x^p + y^p = (x+y)(x+\zeta y) \cdots (x+\zeta^{p-1}y)
      </me>,
      where <m>\zeta = e^{2\pi i/p}</m> is a primitive <m>p</m>-th root of unity in <m>\C</m>.
      However, the ring <m>\Z[\zeta] = \setof{a_0 + a_1 \zeta + a_2 \zeta^2 + \cdots + a_{p-1} \zeta^{p-1}}{a_i\in\Z}</m> is not a unique factorization domain.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are two ways that unique factorization in an integral domain can fail: there can be a failure of a nonzero nonunit to factor into irreducibles, or there can be nonassociate factorizations of the same element. We investigate each in turn.

The term <em>atom</em> was suggested by <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Cohn">Paul Cohn</url> as a synonym for irreducible.

      We now explore the atomic domain <m>R = \Z[\sqrt{-7}] = \setof{a+b\sqrt{-7}}{a,b\in\Z}</m>.
      As we will see, even when a nonzero nonunit can be written as a product of irreducibles, it may be the case that this factorization is not unique.

          Verify that <m>8 = (1+\sqrt{-7})(1-\sqrt{-7})</m>.

    <p>
    	Next, we develop a multiplicative function <m>\delta</m> which enables us to explore the multiplicative properties of <m>\Z[\sqrt{-7}]</m>.

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Define <m>\delta : R \to \N_0</m> by <m>\delta(a+b\sqrt{-7}) = a^2 + 7 b^2</m>.
          Then for all <m>x,y\in R</m>,
          <m>\delta(xy) = \delta(x)\delta(y)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An element <m>u\in R</m> is a unit if and only if <m>\delta(u) = 1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Observe that <m>u</m> is a unit if and only if <m>uv = 1</m> for some <m>v</m>,
        which menas that <m>1 = \delta(1) = \delta(u) \delta(v)</m>,
        so <m>\delta(u) = \delta(v) = 1</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          There do not exist <m>x,y\in \N_0</m> such that <m>2 = x^2 + 7y^2</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose there exist <m>x,y\in \N_0</m> such that <m>2 = x^2 + y^2</m>.
        Then we must have <m>y = 0</m>,
        which means that <m>x^2 = 2</m>, a contradiction.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The elements 2, <m>1+ \sqrt{-7}</m>,
          and <m>1-\sqrt{-7}</m> are irreducible in <m>R</m>.
          We conclude that <m>R</m> is not a UFD.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>2 = ab</m>.
        Then <m>4 = \delta(2) = \delta(a)\delta(b)</m>.
        By the lemma, we may not have <m>\delta(a) = 2</m>,
        which means without loss of generality that <m>\delta(a) = 1</m>,
        and thus <m>a</m> is a unit.
        Therefore, 2 is irreducible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now suppose that <m>1 + \sqrt{-7} = ab</m>.
        Then <m>8 = \delta(1+\sqrt{-7}) = \delta(a) \delta(b)</m>.
        The possible values for <m>\delta(a)</m> are 1, 2, 4, and 8.
        If <m>\delta(a) = 1</m> or 8, then <m>1+\sqrt{-7}</m> is irreducible,
        as either <m>a</m> or <m>b</m> is necessarily a unit.
        By the lemma, we may not have
        <m>\delta(a) = 2</m> or <m>\delta(b) = 2</m>,
        so in fact either <m>\delta(a) = 1</m> or 8.
        Therefore, <m>1\pm \sqrt{-7}</m> is irreducible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we have factored 8 into two different products of irreducibles,
        <m>R</m> is not a UFD.
      </p>
    </proof>
