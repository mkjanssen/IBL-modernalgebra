  <title>The integers</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      As children we start exploring the properties and structure of the positive integers as soon as we learn to count and we extend our understanding throughout our schooling as we learn about new operations and collections of numbers.
      We start our journey into abstract algebra begin with an overview of familiar properties of the integers that are relevant to our course of inquiry.
      With this foundation set,
      we will see in later chapters just how far we can extend these properties in more abstract setting.

      <title>Mathematical Induction</title>

        <p>
          Let <m>P(m)</m> be a statement about the natural number <m>m</m><fn>
          Sample statements could include
          <q><m>m</m> is really interesting</q>
          or
          <q><m>3m^2 + m + 2</m> is even</q>.
          </fn>.
          Let <m>k_0\in \N</m> be such that the statement <m>P(k_0)</m> is true
          (the <em>base case</em>),
          and suppose there is an <m>n\ge k_0</m> such that for all <m>k</m> satisfying <m>k_0 \le k \le n</m>,
          <m>P(k)</m> is true
          (the <em>inductive hypothesis</em>).
          Then <m>P(n+1)</m> is true,
          and thus <m>P(m)</m> is true for all <m>m\ge k_0</m>
          (the <em>inductive step</em>).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      Mathematical induction is sort of like climbing an infinite staircase.
      The <em>base case</em> tells us that we can take a first step on the staircase
      (<m>k_0</m>).
      In the <em>inductive hypothesis</em>,
      we assume we can take all the steps up to a certain height
      (<m>n</m>).
      In the <em>inductive step</em>,
      we prove that this allows us to take the <m>(n+1)</m>st step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, if we can take step <m>k_0</m>, we can
      (by the inductive step)
      take step <m>k_0 + 1</m>.
      And since we can take step <m>k_0 + 1</m>, we can
      (again by the inductive step)
      take step <m>k_0 + 2</m>.
      And so on, forever
      (or, if the notion of actual infinity makes you uncomfortable,
      as far as we want to go).
    </p>
    <p>
      It can be proved that the principle of mathematical induction is logically equivalent to the well-ordering principle.
      That is, if we assume either one to be true, we can deduce the other.
      We will generally take the well-ordering principle on <m>\N</m> to be an axiom,
      and treat induction as a theorem.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For all <m>n \ge 1</m>,
          <me>

    </example>
    <p>
      <em>Proof:</em> <em>Base case:</em> When <m>n = 1</m>,
      the equation <m>1 = \frac{1\cdot (1+1)}{2}</m> is true.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Inductive Hypothesis:</em> Assume that there exists a <m>n</m> such that whenever <m>k \le n</m>,
      the equation
      <me>
        1+ 2 + 3 + \cdots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}

      is true.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Inductive Step:</em> Our goal is to show that <m>P(n+1)</m> is true.
      That is, we wish to establish that

      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We begin on the left-hand side,
      where we may apply the inductive hypothesis to see that

      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the use of straightforward algebra,
      the right-hand side becomes
      <men xml:id="ex_indstep2">
        \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + (n+1) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + \frac{2(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n(n+1) + 2(n+1)}{2} = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}
      </men>.

    <p>
      Putting <xref ref="ex_indstep1" /> and <xref ref="ex_indstep2" /> together,
      we obtain

        1+ 2 + 3 + \cdots + n + (n+1) = \frac{(n+1)((n+1)+1)}{2}

    <title>Divisibility in the integers</title>
    <p>
      In this section,
      we begin to explore some of the arithmetic and algebraic properties of <m>\Z</m>.
      One of the primary goals of this sections is to formalize definitions that you've been using and have an intuitive understanding of.
      At first glance,
      this might seem to add an unnecessary layer of complication.
      However, it will be abundantly clear as we move forward that a formalized mathematical language and notation are necessary to extend these properties to a more abstract setting.
      We begin with a twist on a familiar notion.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>a,b\in \Z</m>.
          We say that <m>a</m> <term>divides</term>
          <m>b</m>, and write <m>a\mid b</m>,
          if there is an integer <m>c</m> such that <m>ac = b</m>.
          If no such <m>c\in Z</m> exists, we write <m>a\nmid b</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Note that the symbol <m>|</m> is a <em>verb</em>;
      it is therefore correct to say,
      e.g., <m>2|4</m>, as 2 <em>does</em> divide 4.
      However, it is an abuse of notation to say that <m>2\mid 4 = 2</m>.
      Instead, we likely mean <m>4\div 2 = 2</m> or <m>\frac{4}{2} = 2</m>
      (though we will not deal in fractions just yet).

      <url href="http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/4/NBT/B/6/">our experience in elementary mathematics does apply:
      there is often something left over (a remainder)</url>.
      The following theorem formalizes this idea for <m>a,b\in \N</m>.

    <theorem xml:id="thm_divalg">
      <title>The Division algorithm</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>a,b\in \N</m>.
          Then there exist unique integers <m>q,r</m> such that <m>a = bq + r</m>,
          where <m>0 \le r \lt b</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Note that this theorem has two parts:
          existence and uniqueness.
          Don't try to do them both at once!</em>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        First, assume that <m>a \lt b</m>.
        Then <m>q = 0</m> and <m>r = a</m> are sufficient.
        If <m>a = b</m>, then <m>q = 1</m> and <m>r = 0</m> will work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, assume that <m>a > b</m>.
        Then the set <m>S = \setof{s\in\N}{a-bs \ge 0}</m> is nonempty.
        Further, note that <m>S</m> has a largest element:
        every element <m>x\in S</m> satisfies <m>x \le a</m>, since <m>a,b\in\N</m>.
        Let <m>q</m> be the largest element of <m>S</m>,
        and set <m>r = a - bq</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To finish the proof,
        it is enough to show that this choice of <m>r</m> satisfies <m>0\le r \le b-1</m>.
        Observe that <m>r\in S</m>, so <m>r\ge 0</m>.
        If <m>r \ge b</m>, then <m>a - b(q+1) = a-bq -b = r -b \ge 0</m>.
        Since <m>q+1 > q</m>,
        this is a contradiction to the assumption that <m>q</m> was the largest element of <m>S</m>.
        Thus, <m>r \lt b</m>, i.e., <m>r \le b-1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>q,q',r,r'</m> be such that <m>a = bq+r</m> and <m>a=bq'+r'</m>.
        We see that <m>bq+r = bq' + r'</m>,
        so <m>b(q-q') = r'-r</m>, so <m>b|r'-r</m>.
        If <m>r'-r = 0</m>, we are done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, <m>r'-r</m> is a nonzero multiple of <m>n</m>.
        If <m>r' \ge r</m>,
        then <m>0\le b(q-q') = r' - r \le b-1 - r</m>, a contradiction.
        Similarly, if <m>r' \le r</m>,
        write <m>b(q'-q) = r-r' \ge 0</m>,
        and a symmetric argument leads to a contradiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, <m>r' = r</m>, so <m>b(q-q') = 0</m>,
        and since <m>b > 0</m>, <m>q - q'= 0</m>, i.e., <m>q = q'</m>.

          This approach to the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic is adapted from<nbsp /><xref ref="NTI" />.
          </fn> Every natural number <m>n > 1</m> is either a prime number or it can be expressed as a finite product of prime numbers.
          That is, for every natural number <m>n > 1</m>,
          there exist primes <m>p_1, p_2, \ldots,
          p_m</m> and natural numbers <m>r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_m</m> such that
          <me>
            n = p_1^{r_1} p_2^{r_2} \cdots p_m^{r_m}

          Use the Well-Ordering Principle (or something equivalent to it.)
        </p>
      </hint>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        It is enough to show that,
        if <m>n > 1</m>, we may write <m>n = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_k</m>,
        where the <m>p_i</m>'s are not necessarily distinct primes.
        Then we can collect the common primes and write them with exponent notation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that when <m>n = 2</m>, there is such an expression,
        so let <m>k > 2</m> be the least positive integer that fails to be expressed as above.
        We note that <m>k</m> cannot be prime,
        or it could be expressed as above.
        Thus, by Theorem 2.1, there is a prime <m>p</m> such that <m>k = p b</m>,
        where <m>1 \lt p, b \lt k</m>.
        Since <m>k</m> was the least positive integer that cannot be factored as a product of primes,
        <m>b</m> has a prime factorization.
        But then so does <m>k</m>, a contradiction.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>p</m> and <m>q_1, q_2,\ldots,
          q_n</m> all be primes and let <m>k</m> be a natural number such that <m>pk = q_1 q_2 \ldots q_n</m>.
          Then <m>p = q_i</m> for some <m>i</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We first state a claim that will be useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Claim 1:</em> If <m>p,q</m> are primes such that <m>p|q</m>,
        then <m>p = q</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Proof of Claim 1:</em> Since
        <m>p,
        q > 1</m> and both <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are prime,
        <m>p = q</m> by the definition of primality.
        <m>\checkmark</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now assume that <m>pk = q_1 q_2 \cdots q_n = (q_1 q_2 \cdots q_{n-1}) q_n</m>.
        If <m>p|q_n</m>, we're done by Claim 1.
        If not, the definition of a prime guarantees that <m>p| q_1 q_2 \cdots q_{n-1}</m>.
        If <m>p|q_{n-1}</m>, we're done by Claim 1.
        Otherwise, <m>p|q_1 q_2 \cdots q_{n-2}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Repeating this process,
        we see that either <m>p|q_i</m> for some <m>i > 2</m>,
        or <m>p|q_1 q_2</m>.
        Now the definition of a prime guarantees that <m>p|q_1</m> or <m>p|q_2</m>,
        in which case Claim 1 requires that <m>p = q_1</m> or <m>p = q_2</m>.

          Moreover, if <m>p_i = q_j</m>, then <m>r_i = t_j</m>.
          In other words,
          if we express the same natural number as a product of distinct primes,
          then the expressions are identical except for the ordering of the factors.

    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Without loss of generality,
        assume <m>p_1 \lt  p_2 \lt  \cdots \lt  p_m</m> and <m>q_1 \lt  q_2 \lt  \cdots \lt  q_s</m>.
        Given a <m>p_i</m>,
        we know that <m>p_i | q_1^{t_1} q_2^{t_2} \cdots q_s^{t_s}</m>,
        which implies that <m>p_i | q_j</m> for some <m>j</m> by Claim 2 in the proof of Lemma 2.8.
        Further, Lemma 2.8 implies that <m>p_i = q_j</m>, and similarly,
        given a <m>q_j</m>, <m>q_j = p_i</m> for some <m>i</m>.
        Thus, <m>m =s</m>,
        and by the ordering of the <m>p_i</m>'s and <m>q_j</m>'s, we have <m>p_i = q_j</m>,
        <m>i = 1, 2, \ldots, m</m>.
        Therefore,
        <me>
          n = p_1^{r_1} p_2^{r_2} \cdots p_m^{r_m} = p_1^{t_1} p_2^{t_2} \cdots p_m^{t_m}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, assume by way of contradiction,
        that <m>r_i \ne t_i</m> for some <m>i</m>.
        Without loss of generality, we may assume <m>r_i \lt  t_i</m>.
        Then <m>p_i^{t_i} | p_1^{r_1} p_2^{r_2} \cdots p_m^{r_m}</m>,
        which implies that
        <me>
          p_i^{t_i - r_i} | p_1^{r_1} p_2^{r_2} \cdots \hat{p}_i^{r_i} \cdots p_m^{r_m}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>t_i - r_i > 0</m>, we have that
        <me>
          p_i  | p_1^{r_1} p_2^{r_2} \cdots \hat{p}_i^{r_i} \cdots p_m^{r_m}
        </me>,
        from which <m>p_i | p_j</m> for some <m>j\ne i</m> by Lemma 2.8.
        This is a contradiction,
        so <m>r_i = t_i</m> for <m>i = 1, 2, \ldots, m</m>.

      If you are familiar with 'military time' then you understand that eighteen hundred hours and 6:00pm are equivalent ways of representing the same time.
      Similarly, it is common knowledge that if it is 10:00am now,
      it will again be 10:00am in 24 hours
      (albeit on a different day).
      Whether you realize it or not,
      when you are working with time
      (in hours)
      you are working in the integers modulo 12,
      a concept that is rooted in the mathematical idea of equivalence classes.

      <p>
        Let <m>a\in \Z</m>.

        Thus, <m>\equiv_m</m> is reflexive.

      <p>
        Let <m>a,b\in \Z</m> such that <m>a\equiv_m b</m>.
        This means that <m>m|a-b</m>,
        so there is some <m>k\in \Z</m> such that <m>mk = a-b</m>.
        Then <m>m(-k) = b-a</m>, so <m>m|b-a</m> and <m>b \equiv_m a</m>.
        Thus, <m>\equiv_m</m> is symmetric.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, let <m>a,b,c\in \Z</m> such that
        <m>a\equiv_m b</m> and <m>b\equiv_m c</m>.
        Then <m>m|a-b</m> and <m>m|b-c</m>,
        so there are integers <m>k_1, k_2</m> such that
        <m>m k_1 = a-b</m> and <m>m k_2 = b-c</m>.
        Summing these equations yields <m>m(k_1 + k_2) = (a-b) + (b-c) = a-c</m>,

    <proof>
      <p>
        In <m>\Z_p</m>,
        every nonzero equivalence class is represented by an <m>x</m> for which <m>\gcd(x,p) = 1</m>.
        Apply the previous theorem.
