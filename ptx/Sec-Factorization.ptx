      One of the most beautiful consequences of an abstract study of algebra is the fact that both <m>\Z</m> and <m>F[x]</m> are Euclidean domains.
      While they are not
      <q>the same</q>,
      we can expect them to share many of the same properties.
      In this section,
      our first goal will be to extend familiar properties from <xref ref="Sec-Integers">&#xa7;</xref> to <m>F[x]</m>.
      We will also see that the particular nature of a polynomial allows for additional criteria for,
      e.g., its irreducibility to be discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      We saw in <xref ref="thm_divalg"></xref>
      and <xref ref="theorem_polydivalg"></xref>
      that both <m>\Z</m> and <m>F[x]</m> have a division algorithm.
      It is reasonable
      (and correct)
      to expect that similar to the integers we can also investigate the greatest common divisor of polynomials.

          Let <m>F</m> be a field, and <m>p(x)\in F[x]</m>.
          Then <m>\alpha\in F</m> is a root of <m>p(x)</m> if and only if <m>x-\alpha</m> divides <m>p(x)</m>.

    <proof>
      <p>
        If <m>x-\alpha</m> divides <m>p(x)</m>,
        then <m>p(x) = q(x) (x-\alpha)</m> and <m>p(\alpha) = q(\alpha) (\alpha - \alpha) = 0</m>,
        so <m>\alpha</m> is a root.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, use the division algorithm to divide <m>p(x)</m> by <m>x-\alpha</m>.
        Then <m>p(x) = q(x)(x-\alpha) + r</m>,
        where <m>\deg r \lt \deg (x-\alpha) = 1</m>.
        Thus, <m>r</m> is a nonzero constant.
        If <m>\alpha</m> is a root of <m>p</m>,
        then <m>0 = p(\alpha) = q(\alpha) (\alpha - \alpha) + r = 0 + r = r</m>,
        so <m>r=0</m> and <m>x-\alpha | p(x)</m>.

          Every polynomial of degree 1 in <m>F[x]</m> is irreducible.

    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>f(x)</m> be degree 1 and write <m>f(x) = s(x) t(x)</m>.
        Then <m>\deg f = 1 = \deg s + \deg t</m>.
        Since <m>\deg s, \deg t \ge 0</m>,
        one of <m>\deg s</m> or <m>\deg t</m> is 0, hence <m>s</m> or <m>t</m> is constant.

          A nonconstant polynomial <m>f(x)\in F[x]</m> of degree 2 or 3 is irreducible over <m>F</m> if and only if it has no zeros in <m>F</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We prove the double contrapositive:
        <m>f(x)\in F[x]</m> of degree 2 or 3 is reducible if and only if it has a zero in <m>F</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>f(x)</m> is reducible there exist nonconstant
        <m>s(x),t(x)\in F[x]</m> such that <m>f(x) = s(x) t(x)</m>.
        Since <m>\deg f = 2</m> or 3, one of <m>s(x)</m> or <m>t(x)</m> has degree 1, and is thus of the form <m>x-\alpha</m>,
        where <m>\alpha \in F</m>.
        Thus, <m>f</m> has a zero.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, if <m>f</m> has a zero <m>\alpha\in F</m>,
        <m>f(x) = (x-\alpha)g(x)</m>,
        where <m>\deg g \ge 1</m>.
        Thus, <m>f</m> is reducible over <m>F</m>.

          Then <m>p(x)</m> divides <m>f(x)</m> or <m>p(x)</m> divides <m>g(x)</m>.

      <p>
        Assume <m>p(x)</m> does not divede <m>f(x)</m>.

        Multiplying by <m>g(x)</m> yields
        <m>g(x)=g(x)s(x)p(x)+g(x)t(x)f(x)</m> which implies that <m>p(x)</m> divides <m>g(x)</m> (since <m>p(x)</m> divides <m>f(x)g(x)</m>) .

    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a PID and suppose that a non-zero non-unit element <m>a\in R</m> can be factored in two different ways as a product of irreducibles.
        <me>
          a=p_1p_2\cdots p_r=q_1q_2\cdots q_s
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Assume that <m>s\geq r</m>.
        Since <m>p_1</m> is irreducible
        (and therefore prime),
        there exists <m>j</m> such that <m>p_1 \mid q_j</m>.
        Since <m>q_j</m> is irreducible as well,
        there is a unit <m>u_1</m> such that <m>p_1=u_1 q_j</m>.
        Up to reordering we have
        <me>
          p_1p_2\cdots p_r=u_1p_1q_2\cdots q_s

      <p>
        Therefore
        <me>
          p_2\cdots p_r=u_1q_2\cdots q_s
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We can continue in a similar fashion until we end up with

          1=u_1\cdots u_rq_{r+1}\cdots q_s
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the <m>q_j</m>'s are non-units,
        this means that <m>r=s</m> and that the <m>p_i</m>'s are associates of the <m>q_j</m>'s.
        Therefore <m>R</m> is a UFD.

      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a euclidean domain,
        and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
        If <m>I = \set{0}</m>, then <m>I</m> is principal,
        so assume that <m>I\ne \set{0}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Define <m>S = \setof{\delta(x)>0}{x\in I}</m>.
        Then the Well-Ordering Principle guarantees that <m>S</m> has a least element.
        Let <m>d\in I</m> be such that <m>\delta(d) > 0</m> is minimal.
        We claim that <m>I = \ideal{d}</m>.

      <p>
        Clearly <m>\ideal{d}\subseteq I</m>.
        Now assume that <m>a\in I</m>,
        and write <m>a = dq + r</m>,
        where either <m>r = 0</m> or <m>r\ne 0</m> and <m>\delta(r) \lt \delta(d)</m>.
        If <m>\delta(r) \lt \delta(d)</m>,
        then <m>r = a - dq \in I</m>,

        Thus, <m>r = 0</m>, and <m>a\in \ideal{d}</m>.

    <title>Nonunique Factorization</title>
    <p>
      If every ring had the unique factorization property,
      life would be very boring indeed.
      And in fact,
      the failure of certain rings in algebraic number theory to have the unique factorization property played a role in several failed attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem,
      which says that there are no nontrivial integer solutions to the equation <m>x^n + y^n = z^n</m> if <m>n \ge 3</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1847, Gabriel Lam&#xe9; claimed he had complete solved the problem.
      His solution relied on the factorization of <m>x^p + y^p</m>,
      where <m>p</m> is an odd prime, as
      <me>
        x^p + y^p = (x+y)(x+\zeta y) \cdots (x+\zeta^{p-1}y)
      </me>,
      where <m>\zeta = e^{2\pi i/p}</m> is a primitive <m>p</m>-th root of unity in <m>\C</m>.
      However, the ring <m>\Z[\zeta] = \setof{a_0 + a_1 \zeta + a_2 \zeta^2 + \cdots + a_{p-1} \zeta^{p-1}}{a_i\in\Z}</m> is not a unique factorization domain.

      In the following exercises,
      we explore factorization in a similar integral domain,
      <m>R = \Z[\sqrt{-7}] = \setof{a+b\sqrt{-7}}{a,b\in\Z}</m>.

          The elements 2, <m>1+ \sqrt{-7}</m>,
          and <m>1-\sqrt{-7}</m> are irreducible in <m>R</m>.
          Thus, <m>R</m> is not a UFD.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>2 = ab</m>.
        Then <m>4 = \delta(2) = \delta(a)\delta(b)</m>.
        By the lemma, we may not have <m>\delta(a) = 2</m>,
        which means without loss of generality that <m>\delta(a) = 1</m>,
        and thus <m>a</m> is a unit.
        Therefore, 2 is irreducible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now suppose that <m>1 + \sqrt{-7} = ab</m>.
        Then <m>8 = \delta(1+\sqrt{-7}) = \delta(a) \delta(b)</m>.
        The possible values for <m>\delta(a)</m> are 1, 2, 4, and 8.
        If <m>\delta(a) = 1</m> or 8, then <m>1+\sqrt{-7}</m> is irreducible,
        as either <m>a</m> or <m>b</m> is necessarily a unit.
        By the lemma, we may not have
        <m>\delta(a) = 2</m> or <m>\delta(b) = 2</m>,
        so in fact either <m>\delta(a) = 1</m> or 8.
        Therefore, <m>1\pm \sqrt{-7}</m> is irreducible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we have factored 8 into two different products of irreducibles,
        <m>R</m> is not a UFD.
