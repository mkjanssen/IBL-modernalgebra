    While it is difficult to intuitively define the way in which mathematics is structural,
    its concern with <em>number</em> is clear,
    especially for students of elementary mathematics such as arithmetic.
    However, the study of <em>number</em>
    rapidly leads one to structural questions regarding the properties of numbers themselves,
    which has historically been the domain of <em>algebra</em>.

    In<nbsp /><xref ref="franklin2014aristotelian" />,
    the author defines a <em>purely structural property</em> as one that
    <q>can be defined wholly in terms of the concepts same and different,
    and part and whole (along with purely logical concepts).</q>
    This definition and its reference to parts and wholes calls to mind the history of the word
    <em>algebra</em> itself,
    which comes from the Arabic <em>al-jabr</em>, literally meaning
    <q>the reunion of broken parts</q>.
    One of the concepts fundamental to the historical development of algebra is the notion of <em>factorization</em>;
    closely related questions that have driven the development of algebra over the centuries are:
    when does a polynomial equation have solutions in a particular number system,
    and is there a systematic way to find them?

    The goal of these notes is to explore the idea of factorization from an abstract perspective.
    We will first give attention to factorization in the integers,
    and then factorization properties of polynomials.
    Our larger goal is to precisely describe deep structural properties common to both the integers and polynomials that guarantee that factorization into fundamental pieces,
    like primes and irreducibles,
    can be done <em>uniquely</em>.
    In order to accomplish this goal,
    we will walk in the realms of abstraction,
    and catch glimpses of the beauty and incredible power of this perspective on mathematics.
