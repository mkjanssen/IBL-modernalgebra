    <p>
      You have been exploring numbers and the patterns they hide within them since your earliest school days.
      In Chapter 1 we reminded ourselves about some of those patterns
      (with the goal of understanding factorization)
      and worked to express them in a more formal way.
      You may find yourself wondering why we are going out of our way to complicate ideas you have understood since elementary school.
      The reason for the abstraction
      (and the reason for this course!)
      is so that we can explore just how far we can push these patterns.
      How far does our understanding of factorization in the integers stretch to other types of numbers and other mathematical objects (like polynomials)?
      In this chapter we will set the ground work for answering that question by introducing ideas that will assist us in streamlining our investigation into factorization.

      		In this section, we'll seek to answer the questions:
      		<ul>
      			<li>What are binary operations?</li>
      			<li>What is a field? What sorts of things can one do in a field?</li>

    <p>
      We now begin the process of abstraction.
      We will do this in stages, beginning with the concept of a <em>field</em>.
      First, we need to formally define some familiar sets of numbers.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The rational numbers, denoted by <m>\Q</m>, is the set
          <me>
            \Q = \setof{\frac{a}{b}}{a,b\in \Z, \ b\ne 0}
          </me>.
        </p>

    <p>
      Recall that in elementary school,
      you learned that two fractions
      <m>\frac{a}{b}, \frac{c}{d} \in \Q</m> are equivalent if and only if <m>ad=bc</m>.
    </p>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that our elementary school definition of equivalent fractions is an equivalence relation. Recall <xref ref="def-eqrel" />.

      </statement>
    </activity>
    <p>
      We likely have an intuitive idea of what is meant by <m>\R</m>,
      the set of real numbers.
      Defining <m>\R</m> rigorously is actually quite difficult,
      and occupies a significant amount of time in a first course in real analysis.
      Thus, we will make use of your intuition.
      <!--It is certainly the case that <m>\N\subseteq \Z\subseteq \Q\subseteq \R</m>,
      but <m>\R</m> also contains many irrational numbers,
      such as <m>\pi</m>, <m>e</m>,
      <m>\sqrt{2}</m>, and so on.-->
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of <m>\R</m> we may build the complex numbers.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>complex numbers</term> consist of all expressions of the form <m>a+bi</m>,
          where <m>a,b\in \R</m> and <m>i^2 = -1</m>.
          Given <m>z = a+bi</m>, we say <m>a</m> is the <term>real part</term>
          of <m>z</m> and <m>b</m> is the
          <term>imaginary part</term>.
          The set of complex numbers is denoted <m>\C</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    
    <p>
    As was mentioned in the <xref ref="Sec-Introduction" text="custom">Introduction</xref>, <em>algebra</em> comes from an Arabic word meaning <q>the reunion of broken parts</q>.
    We therefore need a way of combining two elements of a set into one; we turn to a particular type of function, known as a binary operation, to accomplish this.

      The hallmark of modern pure mathematics is the use of <em>axioms</em>.
      An axiom is essentially an unproved assertion of truth.
      Our use of axioms serves several purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a logical perspective,
      axioms help us avoid the problem of infinite regression (e.g., asking
      <em>How do you know?</em> over and over again).
      That is, axioms give us very clear starting points from which to make our deductions.
    </p>
    <!--<p>
      More generally,
      the use of any hypotheses when asking mathematical or scientific questions is a form of creativity,
      and even <em>play</em>.
      God has created us in His image,
      and he is a creative being.
      The definitions we make and the theorems we prove are reflections of the
      <em>imago Dei</em> in us.
      Of course, we do not have the power to create <em>ex nihilo</em>;
      instead, our tools are the mathematical <em>aspects</em>
      God has imbued in his creation.
      We can postulate structures with whichever axioms we like,
      but our creativity is most valuable if it reflects the world <em>as it is</em>.
    </p>-->
    <p>
      To that end,
      our first abstract algebraic structure captures and axiomatizes familiar behavior about how numbers can be combined to produce other numbers of the same type.

      In the <xref ref="exer_fieldexamples" />,
      you determined which of sets of familiar mathematical objects are and are not fields.
      Notice that you have been working with fields for years and that our abstraction of language to that of fields is simply to allow us to explore the common features at the same time - it is inefficient to prove the same statement about every single field when we can prove it once and for all about fields in general.

    <proof>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Assume <m>0, 0'</m> both satisfy the additive identity axiom.
            Observe that <m>0 = 0 + 0' = 0'</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            As <m>0 = 0 + 0</m>,
            we may write <m>a\cdot 0 = a\cdot (0 + 0) = a\cdot 0 + a \cdot 0</m>.
            Now add the additive inverse of
            <m>a\cdot 0</m> to both sides to obtain <m>0 = a \cdot 0 = 0\cdot a</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Let <m>a\in F</m> and suppose <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> are such that
            <m>a+c = 0</m> and <m>a+b = 0</m>.
            Then <m>a+c = a+b</m>, and we may add <m>b</m>
            (or <m>c</m>)
            to both sides to obtain <m>b+(a+b) = (b+a)+b = 0 + b = b</m> and <m>c+(a+c) = (c+a)+c = 0 + c = c</m>.
            Thus <m>b=c</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Suppose <m>1</m> and <m>1'</m> are multiplicative identities.
            Then <m>1 = 1 \cdot 1' = 1'</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Let <m>a\in F</m> be nonzero and suppose <m>b,c</m> are multiplicative inverses for <m>a</m>.
            Then <m>ab = 1 = ac</m>, and we may multiply by <m>b</m>
            (or <m>c</m>)
            to obtain <m>b(ab) = (ba)b = 1\cdot b = b = b(ac) = (ba)c = 1\cdot c = c</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<p>
        		Observe that <m>(-1) + 1 = 0</m> by the definition of additive inverses. Multiply both sides by <m>-1</m> and distribute to obtain <m>(-1)(-1) + (-1)\cdot 1 = (-1)\cdot 0</m>.
        		By part 2 of this theorem and the definition of a multiplicative identity, we obtain <m>(-1)(-1) + (-1) = 0</m>. We now add the multiplicative identity to obtain <m>(-1)(-1) + (-1) + 1 = 0 + 1</m>, which simplifies to <m>(-1)(-1) = 1</m>.

    </proof>
    <p>
      One consequence of <xref ref="thm_fieldproperties" /> is that,
      given <m>a\in F</m>, <m>b\in F\setminus \set{0}</m>,
      we may refer to <m>-a</m> as <em>the</em>
      additive inverse of <m>a</m>,
      and <m>b^{-1}</m> as <em>the</em>
      multiplicative inverse of <m>b</m>.
      We will thus employ this familiar terminology henceforth.

      In the previous section,
      we observed that many familiar number systems are fields but that some are not.
      As we will see, these non-fields are often more structurally interesting, at least from the perspective of factorization; thus, in this section, we explore them in more detail.
      Before we proceed with that endeavor we will give a formal definition of polynomial so that we can include it in our work.

      In the 1920s, Emmy Noether was the first to explicitly describe the ring axioms as we know them today,
      and her definition of a (not-necessarily-commutative) ring has led to a great deal of interesting work in algebra,
      number theory, and geometry, including the
      (see <xref ref="SubSec-Nonunique-Factorization" />
      for more on the historical development of the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem).
      Most modern definitions of <em>ring</em>

      The following theorem states that the set of polynomials with coefficients in a ring <m>R</m> is itself a ring under the usual operations of polynomial addition of like terms,
      and multiplication via distribution.
      The proof is not tricky, but a rigorous justification
      (especially of, e.g., the associativity of polynomial multiplication)
      is tedious, and thus is omitted.

      In other words, a unit in a ring is a nonzero element with a multiplicative inverse.
      The existence of units is the primary difference between fields and commutative rings with identity: in a field, all nonzero elements are units, while in a commutative ring with identity, no nonzero elements need be units, as <xref ref="thm-cri-field" /> demonstrates.

        <p>
          A commutative ring with identity <m>R</m> in which every nonzero element is a unit is a field.

    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Compare the axioms for a commutative ring with identity and a field.
        The only thing missing from the ring axioms is the existence of multiplicative inverses for nonzero elements.

      Notice that the reason the idea of zero divisors at first appears weird is that they are not something we encounter when working with our familiar sets of numbers, such as <m>\Z</m> or <m>\R</m>.
      In fact, we specifically use the fact that there are no zero divisors in our familiar numbers systems to solve equations in high school algebra (e.g., if <m>(x-2)(x+5)=0</m>,
      then <m>(x-2)=0</m> or <m>x+5=0</m>).
      The lack of zero divisors is one of the properties that does not persist in our abstraction from the integers to rings in general.

      When we introduced the notion of integral domain,
      we said that part of the reason for the definition was to capture some of the most essential properties of the integers. This is the heart of abstraction and generalization in mathematics: to distill the important properties of our objects of interest and explore the consequences of <em>those</em> properties.
      One such important property of <m>\Z</m> is <em>cancellation</em>.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-domaincancel">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a ring.
          Then <m>R</m> is a domain if and only if for all <m>a,b,c\in R</m> with
          <m>c\ne 0</m> and <m>ac = bc</m>, we have <m>a = b</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Assume <m>R</m> is a domain and <m>ac = bc</m>.
        Then <m>ac - bc = 0</m>, so <m>c(a-b) = 0</m>.
        Since <m>R</m> is a domain,
        it has no zero divisors, and therefore either <m>c = 0</m> or <m>a-b=0</m>.
        The first possibility is ruled out by our assumptions on <m>a,b,c</m>,
        so we must have <m>a-b = 0</m>, or <m>a =b</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, assume that <m>R</m> is not a domain.
        Let <m>z\in R</m> be a zero divisor;
        then there is a nonzero <m>x\in R</m> such that <m>xz = 0 = 0 z</m>.
        This implies that <m>x = 0</m>, a contradiction.

    </theorem>

    <p>
      We may read <xref ref="thm-domaincancel" /> as saying that the defining property of an integral domain is the ability to
      cancel common nonzero factors.
      Note that we have not <em>divided</em>;
      division is not a binary operation, and nonzero elements of rings need not be units.
      However, as was the case in <m>\Z</m>,
      there are notions of <em>divisibility</em>
      and <em>factorization</em> in rings.

      Our definition of prime also extends nicely to domains.
      Indeed, the desire to extend the familiar notion of prime from <m>\Z</m> to any ring is the reason for our less-familiar definition given in <xref ref="def-primeinteger" />.

          Let <m>R</m> be a domain.
          We say a nonzero nonunit element <m>a\in R</m> is <term>prime</term>
          if whenever <m>a\mid bc</m> for some <m>b,c\in R</m>,

      A notion related to primality is irreducibility.
      In fact, one might reasonably say that irreducibility is the natural generalization of the typical definition of prime one encounters in school mathematics.

    		In domains, all primes are irreducible.

    <theorem xml:id="thm-primesareirredindomains">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a domain.
          If <m>a\in R</m> is prime, then <m>a</m> is irreducible.
        </p>

      <p>
        Compare to the proof of <xref ref="theorem_euclidslemma">Theorem</xref>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>a\in R</m> be prime,
        and suppose that <m>a = bc</m> for some <m>b,c\in R</m>.
        Then <m>a|bc</m>, so by definition either <m>a|b</m> or <m>a|c</m>.
        Without loss of generality, assume <m>a|b</m>.
        Then there is a <m>k\in R</m> such that <m>ak=b</m>, so <m>a = (ak)c</m>,
        and we may cancel <m>a</m> to obtain <m>1_R = kc</m>.
        Thus, <m>c</m> is a unit, making <m>a</m> irreducible.

    <p>
      In familiar settings,
      the notion of prime and irreducible exactly coincide.

        Then <m>p = de</m>.
        Since <m>p</m> is irreducible,
        either <m>d</m> or <m>e</m> is a unit.
        However, the only units are <m>\pm 1</m>,
        so either one of <m>d</m> or <m>e</m> is <m>p</m> or <m>-p</m>.

    	  Despite their overlap in familiar settings, primes and irreducibles are distinct types of elements. As the next exploration demonstrates, not all primes are irreducible.

    	  Our last straightforward generalization from the multiplicative structure of <m>\Z</m> is the notion of greatest common divisor.

      One of the ways in which mathematicians study the <em>structure</em>
      of an abstract object is by considering how it interacts with other (related) objects.
      This is especially true of its <em>sub</em>objects.
      Thus, in linear algebra,
      we are often concerned with <em>subspaces</em>
      of a vector space as a means of understanding the vector space,
      or even submatrices as a way of understanding a matrix
      (see, e.g., the cofactor expansion formula for the determinant).
      In real analysis and topology,
      the important subobjects are usually open sets, or subsequences,
      and the study of a graph's subgraphs is an important approach to many questions in graph theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section,
      we begin a set-theoretic structural exploration of the notion of ring by considering a particularly important class of subring which will be integral to our understanding of factorization.
    </p>
    <p>
      These subrings are called <em>ideals</em>.
      They arose in the work of Kummer and Dedekind as a way of trying to recover some notion of unique factorization in rings that do not have properties like the fundamental theorem of arithmetic in <m>\Z</m>.

      The most important type of ideals
      (for our work, at least),
      are those which are the sets of all multiples of a single element in the ring.
      Such ideals are called <em>principal ideals</em>.
    </p>
    <theorem>

        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be commutative with identity and let <m>a\in R</m>.
          The set
          <me>
            \ideal{a} = \setof{ra}{r\in R}
          </me>
          is an ideal
          (called the <em>principal ideal generated by <m>a</m></em>).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Observe that <m>0 = 0\cdot a \in \ideal{a}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, if <m>r_1 a, r_2 a\in \ideal{a}</m>,
        <m>r_1 a - r_2 a = (r_1 - r_2)a \in \ideal{a}</m>.
        Finally, if <m>x\in R</m> and <m>r a\in \ideal{a}</m>,
        <m>x (ra) = (xr) a \in \ideal{a}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, <m>\ideal{a}</m> is an ideal.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      The element <m>a</m> in the theorem is known as a

        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, suppose <m>\ideal{x}\subseteq \ideal{y}</m>.
          Then <m>x\in \ideal{y}</m>, so <m>y|x</m>.
          Conversely, if <m>y|x</m>,
          then there is some <m>r\in R</m> such that <m>x = yr</m>,

          <m>ax = (ar)y \in \ideal{y}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that this means that if we want to know if <m>\ideal{x}\subseteq \ideal{y}</m>,

        Let <m>I\subseteq Z</m> be an ideal.
        If <m>I = \set{0}</m>, then <m>I = \ideal{0}</m>,
        so suppose there is some nonzero <m>x\in I</m>.
        Define <m>S = \setof{m\in \Z}{m > 0}</m>.

        It is clear that <m>\ideal{d}\subseteq I</m>.
        Now let <m>x\in I</m> be nonzero,

        Observe that <m>0 \le r = x - dq \lt d</m>,
        but as <m>x\in I</m> and <m>-dq \in I</m>,
        we must have <m>r\in I</m>.
        To avoid contradicting the WOP, we must have <m>r = 0</m>.

      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Observe that <m>0 = x0 + y0 \in I</m>.
        Additionally, if <m>x m_1 + y n_1, x m_2 + y n_2\in I</m>,
        then <m>(x m_1 + y n_1) + (x m_2 + y n_2) = x (m_1 + m_2) + y (n_1 + n_2) \in I</m>,
        and <m>r(x m_1 + y n_1) = x (rm_1) + y(rn_1) \in I</m>.
        Thus, <m>I</m> is an ideal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>R</m> is a PID, there exists <m>d\in R</m> such that <m>I = \ideal{d}</m>.
        We claim that <m>d</m> is a GCD of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is clear that <m>d|x</m>, as <m>x\cdot 1 + y\cdot 0\in I = \ideal{d}</m>.
        Similarly, <m>d|y</m>.

      <p>
        Now let <m>e\in R</m> be a common divisor of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
        We wish to show that <m>e|d</m>.
        Write <m>x = e k_1</m> and <m>y = e k_2</m>.
        Since <m>d\in \ideal{d}</m>,
        there exist <m>s,t\in R</m> such that
        <m>d = x s + yt = (e k_1) s + (e k_2)t = e(k_1 s + k_2 t)</m>,
        and thus <m>e|d</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, there exist
        <m>s,t\in R</m> such that a GCD <m>d</m> of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> can be written as <m>d = xs + yt</m>.

      We have so far abstracted and axiomatized several important algebraic properties of <m>\Z</m> that we discussed in <xref ref="Sec-Integers">&#xa7;</xref>.
      In particular,
      we have our usual operations of addition and multiplication,
      and their interactions;
      we have notions of divisibility/factorization,
      irreducibility, and primality;
      we also have cancellation and greatest common divisors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our last major abstraction from <m>\Z</m> is the division algorithm.
      The main obstacle to postulating domains with a division algorithm is a clear notion of comparison relations.
      That is, if <m>R</m> is an arbitrary domain with <m>r,s\in R</m>,
      is it possible to clearly and sensibly say which of <m>r</m> or <m>s</m> is
      <q>bigger</q>
      ? (Recall that this was a requirement for the division algorithm with nonzero remainders.) However,
      if there is a way to relate elements of a domain <m>R</m> to <m>\N_0</m>,
      we can sensibly define a division algorithm.

        Since <m>S</m> contains a nonzero polynomial, <m>T\ne \emptyset</m>.
        By WOP, <m>T</m> contains a minimal element <m>d \ge 0</m>,

          Let <m>F</m> be a field and
          <m>f(x),g(x)\in F[x]</m> with <m>g(x)\ne 0</m>.
          Then there exist unique <m>q(x),
          r(x) \in F[x]</m> such that
          <me>
            f(x) = g(x) q(x) + r(x)

          where <m>\deg(r(x)) \lt  \deg g(x)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          For existence, consider three cases:
          <m>f(x) = 0</m>; <m>f(x) \ne 0</m> and <m>\deg f \lt \deg g</m>;
          <m>f(x) \ne 0</m> and <m>\deg f \ge \deg g</m>.
          In the last case, use induction on <m>m = \deg f(x)</m>.
          For uniqueness,
          mimic the uniqueness proof of <xref ref="thm_divalg">Theorem</xref>.
        </p>
      </hint>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        <em>Existence:</em> If <m>f(x) = 0</m>,
        then <m>q(x) = 0</m> and <m>r(x) = 0</m> will do.
        If <m>f(x)\ne 0</m> and <m>\deg f \lt \deg g</m>,
        then <m>q(x) = 0</m> and <m>r(x) = f(x)</m> will suffice.
        Thus, we need only consider the case in which
        <m>f(x) \ne 0</m> and <m>\deg f \ge \deg g</m>.
        We use induction on <m>\deg f = m</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When <m>m = 0</m>, <m>\deg g \le 0 = \deg f</m>,
        and as <m>g(x) \ne 0</m>, both <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are nonzero constants.
        Then <m>r = 0</m> and <m>q = fg^{-1}</m> will work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now assume <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> exist whenever <m>\deg f \lt m</m>.
        Assume <m>\deg f = m</m> and write
        <m>f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_m x^m</m> and <m>g(x) = b_0 + b_1 x + \cdots + b_n x^n</m>.
        Use <xref ref="lem_polydivalglem">Lemma</xref>
        and set <m>h(x) = f(x) - a_m b_n^{-1} x^{m-n} g(x)</m>,
        which must have degree less than <m>f</m>.
        Thus, by induction, there exist
        <m>q_1, r_1\in F[x]</m> such that <m>h = g q_1 + r_1</m>,
        with <m>r_1 = 0</m> or <m>\deg r_1 \lt \deg g</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We therefore have
        <md>
          <mrow>f(x) \amp = a_m b_n^{-1} x^{m-n} g(x) + h(x)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = a_m b_n^{-1} x^{m-n} g(x) + g(x) q_1(x) + r_1(x)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = (a_m b_n^{-1} x^{m-n} + q_1(x)) g(x) + r_1(x)</mrow>
        </md>,
        where <m>q = a_m b_n^{-1} x^{m-n} + q_1(x)</m> and
        <m>r = r_1(x)</m> have the desired properties.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Uniqueness:</em> Suppose
        <m>f = gq + r</m> and <m>f = g\hat{q} + \hat{r}</m>,
        where <m>r,\hat{r}</m> both have the desired properties.
        Then
        <me>
          0 = g[q - \hat{q}] + [r - \hat{r}]
        </me>,
        or <m>\hat{r} - r = g [q - \hat{q}]</m>.
        Thus either <m>\hat{r} - r = 0</m>,
        or <m>\hat{r} - r</m> has degree at least <m>\deg g</m>.
        The latter is clearly impossible,
        so <m>\hat{r} = r</m> and <m>\hat{q} = q</m>.

    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a euclidean domain,
        and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
        If <m>I = \set{0}</m>, then <m>I</m> is principal,
        so assume that <m>I\ne \set{0}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Define <m>S = \setof{\delta(x)>0}{x\in I}</m>.
        Then the Well-Ordering Principle guarantees that <m>S</m> has a least element.
        Let <m>d\in I</m> be such that <m>\delta(d) > 0</m> is minimal.
        We claim that <m>I = \ideal{d}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clearly <m>\ideal{d}\subseteq I</m>.
        Now assume that <m>a\in I</m>,
        and write <m>a = dq + r</m>,
        where either <m>r = 0</m> or <m>r\ne 0</m> and <m>\delta(r) \lt \delta(d)</m>.
        If <m>\delta(r) \lt \delta(d)</m>,
        then <m>r = a - dq \in I</m>,
        contradicting the minimality of <m>\delta(d)</m>.
        Thus, <m>r = 0</m>, and <m>a\in \ideal{d}</m>.
