  <introduction>
    <p>
      You have been exploring numbers and the patterns they hide within them since you began elementary school
      (if not before).
      In Chapter 1 we reminded ourselves about what some of those patterns are in the integers
      (with the goal of understanding factorization)
      and worked to express them in a more formal way.
      You may find yourself wondering why we are going out of our way to complicate ideas you have understood since elementary school.
      The reason for the abstraction
      (and the reason for this course!)
      is so that we can explore just how far we can push these patterns.
      How far does our understanding of factorization in the integers stretch to other types of numbers and other mathematical objects (like polynomials)?
      In this chapter we will set the ground work for answering that question by introducing more formal notation that will assist us in streamlining our investigation into factorization.

      We now begin the process of abstraction.
      We will do this in stages, beginning with the concept of a <em>field</em>.
      First, we need to formally define some familiar sets of numbers.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The rational numbers, denoted by <m>\Q</m>, is the set
          <me>
            \Q = \setof{\frac{a}{b}}{a,b\in \Z, \ b\ne 0}
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Recall that in elementary school,
      you learned that two fractions
      <m>\frac{a}{b}, \frac{c}{d} \in \Q</m> are equivalent if and only if <m>ad=bc</m>.
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that our elementary school definition of equivalent fractions is an equivalence relation.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      We likely have an intuitive idea of what is meant by <m>\R</m>,
      the set of real numbers.
      Defining <m>\R</m> rigorously is actually quite difficult,
      and will occupy a significant amount of time in a first course in real analysis.
      Thus, we will make use of your intuition.
      It is certainly the case that <m>\N\subseteq \Z\subseteq \Q\subseteq \R</m>,
      but <m>\R</m> also contains many irrational numbers,
      such as <m>\pi</m>, <m>e</m>,
      <m>\sqrt{2}</m>, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of <m>\R</m> we may build the complex numbers.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>complex numbers</term> consist of all expressions of the form <m>a+bi</m>,
          where <m>a,b\in \R</m> and <m>i^2 = -1</m>.
          Given <m>z = a+bi</m>, we say <m>a</m> is the <term>real part</term>
          of <m>z</m> and <m>b</m> is the
          <term>imaginary part</term>.
          The set of complex numbers is denoted <m>\C</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition xml:id="def_binaryoperation">
      <statement>
        <p>
              <idx><h>binary operation</h></idx>
          Let <m>X</m> be a nonempty set.
          A function <m>\star : X \times X \to X</m> is called a
          <term>binary operation</term>.
          If <m>\star</m> is a binary operation on <m>X</m>,
          we say that <m>X</m> is <term>closed under the operation <m>\star</m></term>. [Given <m>a,b\in X</m>,
          we usually write <m>a\star b</m> in place of <m>\star(a,b)</m>.]

    <question>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Which of <m>+, -, \cdot, \div</m> are binary operations:

      <answer>
        <p>
          Division is never a binary operation.
          The others are binary operations on <m>\C</m>,
          <m>\R, \Q</m>, and <m>\Z</m>.
          The only binary operation on <m>\N</m> is addition.
        </p>
      </answer>
    </question>
    <p>
      The hallmark of modern pure mathematics is the use of <em>axioms</em>.
      An axiom is essentially an unproved assertion of truth.
      Our use of axioms serves several purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a logical perspective,
      axioms help us avoid the problem of infinite regression (e.g., asking
      <em>How do you know?</em> over and over again).
      That is, axioms give us very clear starting points from which to make our deductions.
    </p>
    <p>
      More generally,
      the use of any hypotheses when asking mathematical or scientific questions is a form of creativity,
      and even <em>play</em>.
      God has created us in His image,
      and he is a creative being.
      The definitions we make and the theorems we prove are reflections of the
      <em>imago Dei</em> in us.
      Of course, we do not have the power to create <em>ex nihilo</em>;
      instead, our tools are the mathematical <em>aspects</em>
      God has imbued in his creation.
      We can postulate structures with whichever axioms we like,
      but our creativity is most valuable if it reflects the world <em>as it is</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To that end,
      our first abstract algebraic structure captures and axiomatizes familiar behavior about how numbers can be combined to produce other numbers of the same type.

      In the previous exercise,
      you determined which of sets of familiar mathematical objects are and are not fields.
      Notice that you have been working with fields for years and years and that our abstraction of language to that of fields is simply to allow us to explore the common features at the same time - it is inefficient to prove the same statement about every single field when we can prove it once and for all about fields in general.

            As <m>0_F = 0_F + 0_F</m>,
            we may write <m>a\cdot 0_F = a\cdot (0_F + 0_F) = a\cdot 0_F + a \cdot 0_F</m>.
            Now add the additive inverse of
            <m>a\cdot 0_F</m> to both sides to obtain <m>0_F = a \cdot 0_F = 0_F\cdot a</m>.

        <li>
          <p>
            Let <m>a\in F</m> and suppose <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> are such that
            <m>a+c = 0_F</m> and <m>a+b = 0_F</m>.
            Then <m>a+c = a+b</m>, and we may add <m>b</m>
            (or <m>c</m>)
            to both sides to obtain <m>b+(a+b) = (b+a)+b = 0_F + b = b</m> and <m>c+(a+c) = (c+a)+c = 0_F + c = c</m>.
            Thus <m>b=c</m>.

        <li>
          <p>
            Suppose <m>1_F</m> and <m>1_F'</m> are multiplicative identities.
            Then <m>1_F = 1_F 1_F' = 1_F'</m>.

        <li>
          <p>
            Let <m>a\in F</m> be nonzero and suppose <m>b,c</m> are multiplicative inverses for <m>a</m>.
            Then <m>ab = 1_F = ac</m>, and we may multiply by <m>b</m>
            (or <m>c</m>)
            to obtain <m>b(ab) = (ba)b = 1_F b = b = b(ac) = (ba)c = 1_F c = c</m>.

    <p>
      One consequence of <xref ref="thm_fieldproperties">Theorem</xref> is that,
      given <m>a\in F</m>, <m>b\in F\setminus \set{0}</m>,
      we may refer to <m>-a</m> as <em>the</em>
      additive inverse of <m>a</m>,
      and <m>b^{-1}</m> as <em>the</em>
      multiplicative inverse of <m>b</m>.
      We will thus employ this familiar terminology henceforth.

      In the previous section,
      we observed that many familiar number systems are fields but that some are not.
      In this section we will explore which field properties usually hold for familiar sets of numbers and which ones are more specialized.
      Before we proceed with that endeavor we will give a formal definition of polynomial so that we can include it in our exploration.

          Let <m>A</m> be a set, and <m>x</m> a variable.
          We define a <term>polynomial in <m>x</m> with coefficients in <m>A</m></term>
          to be an expression of the form
          <me>
            p = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots + a_n x^n
          </me>,
          where <m>n\in \N_0</m> is the <term>degree</term>
          of the polynomial <m>p</m>,
          denoted <m>\deg(p) = n</m>, and
          <m>a_0,a_1,\ldots,
          a_n</m> are the <term>coefficients</term> of the polynomial.
          The coefficient <m>a_n</m> is known as the
          <term>leading coefficient</term> of <m>p</m>,
          and <m>a_n x^n</m> is the <term>leading term</term> of <m>p</m>.

          we denote the set of all polynomials with coefficients in <m>A</m>.
          If <m>A</m> has an additive identity <m>0</m>,
          then <m>A[x]</m> has a <term>zero polynomial</term>,
          the polynomial whose coefficients are all <m>0</m>.
          The zero polynomial is also often denoted by <m>0</m>.

      In the 1920s, Emmy Noether was the first to describe the ring axioms as we know them today,
      and her definition of a (not-necessarily-commutative) ring has led to a great deal of interesting work in algebra,
      number theory, and geometry, including the
      (see <xref ref="SubSec-Nonunique-Factorization">&#xa7;</xref>
      for more on the historical development of the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem).
      Most modern definitions of <em>ring</em>
      agree with our <xref ref="def_ring">Definition</xref>

      The following theorem states that the set of polynomials with coefficients in a ring <m>R</m> is itself a ring under the usual operations of polynomial addition of like terms,
      and multiplication via distribution.
      The proof is not tricky, but a rigorous justification
      (especially of, e.g., the associativity of multiplication)
      is tedious, and thus is omitted.

      One of the ways to better understand mathematical structures is to understand their similar substructures (e.g., subspaces of vector spaces in linear algebra).
      Again, this is a formalization of an idea that you have been using since you were a child.
      There are certain properties of the rational numbers that you understand because you understand the real numbers - this is because the rational numbers are a subring of the real numbers.

      Notice that the reason the idea of zero divisors at first appears weird is that they're not something we encounter when working with numbers.

      then <m>(x-2)=0</m> or <m>x+5=0</m>).
      The lack of zero divisors is one of the properties that doesn't persist in our abstraction from the integers to rings in general.

        Let <m>a,b\in R</m> such that <m>ab</m> is a zero divisor.
        Then <m>a,b\ne 0</m>
        (else <m>ab = 0</m>).
        Since <m>ab</m> is a zero divisor,

      While there is a well-developed body of literature on (noncommutative) rings
      (possibly without identity),
      from this point on
      (for the sake of brevity),
      and unless stated otherwise,
      when we use the word <em>ring</em>
      we mean <em>commutative ring with identity</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, while even commutative rings with identity and zero divisors are useful in many realms of mathematics,
      we will focus our study on rings with no zero divisors.
      As these rings share many
      (though not all)
      properties of the integers, they are known as integral domains.

    <title>Divisibility in Integral Domains</title>
    <p>
      When we introduced the notion of integral domain,
      we said that part of the reason for the definition was to capture some of the most essential properties of the integers.
      One such idea is that of cancellation.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a ring.
          Then <m>R</m> is a domain if and only if for all <m>a,b,c\in R</m> with
          <m>c\ne 0_R</m> and <m>ac = bc</m>, we have <m>a = b</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Assume <m>R</m> is a domain and <m>ac = bc</m>.
        Then <m>ac - bc = 0</m>, so <m>c(a-b) = 0</m>.
        Since <m>R</m> is a domain,
        it has no zero divisors, and therefore either <m>c = 0</m> or <m>a-b=0</m>.
        The first possibility is ruled out by our assumptions on <m>a,b,c</m>,
        so we must have <m>a-b = 0</m>, or <m>a =b</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, assume that <m>R</m> is not a domain.
        Let <m>z\in R</m> be a zero divisor;
        then there is a nonzero <m>x\in R</m> such that <m>xz = 0 = 0 z</m>.
        This implies that <m>x = 0</m>, a contradiction.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Thus, the defining property of an integral domain is the ability to
      <em>cancel</em> common nonzero factors.
      Note that we have not <em>divided</em>;
      division is not a binary operation in rings!
      However, as was the case in <m>\Z</m>,
      there are notions of <em>divisibility</em>
      and <em>factorization</em> in rings.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring with identity, and let <m>a,b\in R</m>.
          We say <m>a</m> <term>divides</term>
          <m>b</m> and write <m>a\mid b</m> if there is a <m>c\in R</m> such that <m>ac = b</m>.
          We then say that <m>a</m> is a <term>factor</term> of <m>b</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Our notion of primality also extends nicely to domains.

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a domain.

          either <m>a|b</m> or <m>a|c</m>.

      A notion related to primality is irreducibility.

        Then <m>a|bc</m>, so by definition either <m>a|b</m> or <m>a|c</m>.
        Without loss of generality, assume <m>a|b</m>.
        Then there is a <m>k\in R</m> such that <m>ak=b</m>, so <m>a = (ak)c</m>,
        and we may cancel <m>a</m> to obtain <m>1_R = kc</m>.
        Thus, <m>c</m> is a unit, making <m>a</m> irreducible.

          Every irreducible in <m>\Z</m> is prime.

        Let <m>p\in \Z</m> be irreducible,

        Then <m>p = de</m>.
        Since <m>p</m> is irreducible,
        either <m>d</m> or <m>e</m> is a unit.
        However, the only units are <m>\pm 1</m>,
        so either one of <m>d</m> or <m>e</m> is <m>p</m> or <m>-p</m>.
        In either case, <m>p</m> is prime.

        Since <m>d|a</m> and <m>d|b</m> there are <m>k_1,k_2\in R</m> such that
        <m>d k_1 = a</m> and <m>d k_2 = b</m>.
        Then <m>e (u^{-1} k_1) = a</m> and <m>e (u^{-1} k_2) = b</m>,

        Let <m>f</m> be a common divisor of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.

    <title>Principal Ideals</title>
    <p>
      One of the ways in which mathematicians study the <em>structure</em>
      of an abstract object is by considering how it interacts with other (related) objects.
      This is especially true of its <em>sub</em>objects.
      Thus, in linear algebra,
      we are often concerned with <em>subspaces</em>
      of a vector space as a means of understanding the vector space,
      or even submatrices as a way of understanding a matrix
      (see, e.g., the cofactor expansion formula for the determinant).
      In real analysis and topology,
      the important subobjects are usually open sets, or subsequences,
      and the study of a graph's subgraphs is an important approach to many questions in graph theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section,
      we begin a set-theoretic structural exploration of the notion of ring by considering a particularly important class of subring which will be integral to our understanding of factorization.
    </p>
    <p>
      These subrings are called <em>ideals</em>.
      They arose in the work of Kummer and Dedekind as a way of trying to recover some notion of unique factorization in rings that do not have properties like the fundamental theorem of arithmetic in <m>\Z</m>.

      Observe that the third requirement for a set <m>I</m> to be an ideal of <m>R</m> is simplified slightly if <m>R</m> is commutative
      (which, we recall, all of our rings are).
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many important examples and types of ideals,
      but there are also some trivial ideals contained in every ring.

          Let <m>R</m> be a ring.

          All ideals are subrings.

      <p>

      The following theorem provides a useful characterization of when an ideal <m>I</m> is in fact the whole ring.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a ring and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
          Then <m>I = R</m> if and only <m>I</m> contains a unit of <m>R</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        If <m>I = R</m>, <m>1_R\in R</m> will do.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there is a unit <m>u\in I</m>,
        then given any <m>r\in R</m>,
        <m>r = r u^{-1} u = (ru^{-1}) u \in I</m>, so <m>I = R</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      The most important type of ideals
      (for our work, at least),
      are those which are the sets of all multiples of a single element in the ring.
      Such ideals are called <em>principal ideals</em>.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be commutative with identity and let <m>a\in R</m>.
          The set
          <me>
            \ideal{a} = \setof{ra}{r\in R}
          </me>
          is an ideal
          (called the <em>principal ideal generated by <m>a</m></em>).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Observe that <m>0_R = 0_R a \in \ideal{a}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, if <m>r_1 a, r_2 a\in \ideal{a}</m>,
        <m>r_1 a - r_2 a = (r_1 - r_2)a \in \ideal{a}</m>.
        Finally, if <m>x\in R</m> and <m>r a\in \ideal{a}</m>,
        <m>x (ra) = (xr) a \in \ideal{a}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, <m>\ideal{a}</m> is an ideal.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      The element <m>a</m> in the theorem is known as the
      <em>generator</em> of <m>\ideal{a}</m>.

          We have
          <q><m>z\in \ideal{x} \Leftrightarrow x|z</m></q>
          and
          <q><m>\ideal{x}\subseteq \ideal{y} \Leftrightarrow y|x</m></q><fn>
          An acceptable alternative would be:
          <m>x\in \ideal{y}</m>.
          Make sure students are aware of this!
          </fn>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that <m>z\in \ideal{x} \Leftrightarrow \exists r\in R, z = xr \Leftrightarrow x|z</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, suppose <m>\ideal{x}\subseteq \ideal{y}</m>.
          Then <m>x\in \ideal{y}</m>, so <m>y|x</m>.
          Conversely, if <m>y|x</m>,
          then there is some <m>r\in R</m> such that <m>x = yr</m>,
          and thus for all <m>ax\in \ideal{x}</m>,
          <m>ax = (ar)y \in \ideal{y}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that this means that if we want to know if <m>\ideal{x}\subseteq \ideal{y}</m>,
          it's enough to check that <m>x\in \ideal{y}</m>.

      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Observe that <m>0 = x0 + y0 \in I</m>.
        Additionally, if <m>x m_1 + y n_1, x m_2 + y n_2\in I</m>,
        then <m>(x m_1 + y n_1) + (x m_2 + y n_2) = x (m_1 + m_2) + y (n_1 + n_2) \in I</m>,
        and <m>r(x m_1 + y n_1) = x (rm_1) + y(rn_1) \in I</m>.
        Thus, <m>I</m> is an ideal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>R</m> is a PID, there exists <m>d\in R</m> such that <m>I = \ideal{d}</m>.
        We claim that <m>d</m> is a GCD of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is clear that <m>d|x</m>, as <m>x\cdot 1 + y\cdot 0\in I = \ideal{d}</m>.
        Similarly, <m>d|y</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let <m>e\in R</m> be a common divisor of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
        We wish to show that <m>e|d</m>.
        Write <m>x = e k_1</m> and <m>y = e k_2</m>.
        Since <m>d\in \ideal{d}</m>,
        there exist <m>s,t\in R</m> such that
        <m>d = x s + yt = (e k_1) s + (e k_2)t = e(k_1 s + k_2 t)</m>,
        and thus <m>e|d</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, there exist
        <m>s,t\in R</m> such that a GCD <m>d</m> of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> can be written as <m>d = xs + yt</m>.

      We have so far abstracted and axiomatized several important algebraic properties of <m>\Z</m> that we discussed in <xref ref="Sec-Integers">&#xa7;</xref>.
      In particular,
      we have our usual operations of addition and multiplication,
      and their interactions;
      we have notions of divisibility/factorization,
      irreducibility, and primality;
      we also have cancellation and greatest common divisors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our last major abstraction from <m>\Z</m> is the division algorithm.
      The main obstacle to postulating domains with a division algorithm is a clear notion of comparison relations.
      That is, if <m>R</m> is an arbitrary domain with <m>r,s\in R</m>,
      is it possible to clearly and sensibly say which of <m>r</m> or <m>s</m> is
      <q>bigger</q>
      ? (Recall that this was a requirement for the division algorithm with nonzero remainders.) However,
      if there is a way to relate elements of a domain <m>R</m> to <m>\N_0</m>,
      we can sensibly define a division algorithm.

                where either <m>r = 0_R</m> or <m>\delta(r) \lt \delta(b)</m>.

          We call the function <m>\delta</m> a

      Thus, a Euclidean domain is an integral domain with a division algorithm that behaves in a familiar way.

          <m>f(x) \ne 0</m> and <m>\deg f \ge \deg g</m>.

    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        <em>Existence:</em> If <m>f(x) = 0</m>,
        then <m>q(x) = 0</m> and <m>r(x) = 0</m> will do.
        If <m>f(x)\ne 0</m> and <m>\deg f \lt \deg g</m>,
        then <m>q(x) = 0</m> and <m>r(x) = f(x)</m> will suffice.
        Thus, we need only consider the case in which
        <m>f(x) \ne 0</m> and <m>\deg f \ge \deg g</m>.
        We use induction on <m>\deg f = m</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When <m>m = 0</m>, <m>\deg g \le 0 = \deg f</m>,
        and as <m>g(x) \ne 0</m>, both <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are nonzero constants.
        Then <m>r = 0</m> and <m>q = fg^{-1}</m> will work.

      <p>
        Now assume <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> exist whenever <m>\deg f \lt m</m>.
        Assume <m>\deg f = m</m> and write

        Use <xref ref="lem_polydivalglem">Lemma</xref>

        which must have degree less than <m>f</m>.
        Thus, by induction, there exist

        Thus either <m>\hat{r} - r = 0</m>,
