<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">It is enough to show that, if \(n &gt; 1\text{,}\) we may write \(n = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_k\text{,}\) where the \(p_i\)'s are not necessarily distinct primes. Then we can collect the common primes and write them with exponent notation.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Note that when \(n = 2\text{,}\) there is such an expression, so let \(k &gt; 2\) be the least positive integer that fails to be expressed as above. We note that \(k\) cannot be prime, or it could be expressed as above. Thus, by Theorem 2.1, there is a prime \(p\) such that \(k = p b\text{,}\) where \(1 \lt p, b \lt k\text{.}\) Since \(k\) was the least positive integer that cannot be factored as a product of primes, \(b\) has a prime factorization. But then so does \(k\text{,}\) a contradiction.</p></article></body>
