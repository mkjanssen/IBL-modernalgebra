<em class="emphasis">Theorems</em>: A <em class="emphasis">numbered</em> theorem is a statement that students are expected to prove for themselves. The authors generally assign 3â€“6 numbered theorems (or exercises, or lemmas) for each class meeting, with students expected to present their work during the next class. These presentations and the ensuing discussions form the regular work of the class. Students are <em class="emphasis">not</em> expected to prove <em class="emphasis">unnumbered</em> theorems. The unnumbered theorems unify nearby numbered theorems (such as stating an existence theorem and uniqueness theorem as a single result), or are otherwise too technical or complicated to be illuminating. Nonetheless, they are generally important results of which students should be aware.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Sec-NoteToInstructors.html#li-1" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
