<p>This book was written with the belief that the best way to learn mathematics is to <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">do</em> mathematics. Thus, there are vanishingly few worked examples or proved theorems. Instead, you will provide the proofs and solutions to exercises. It is possible, if you look hard enough, to find some of the answers elsewhere on the internet. I implore you to resist the urge to do so. You will learn much more by struggling with a problem, even if you do not ultimately solve it, than you will by searching for an answer after a few minutes of toying with a problem. The rewards of your struggle will be deep and long-lasting.</p>
