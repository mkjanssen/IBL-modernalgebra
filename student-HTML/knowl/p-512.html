<div class="para">Our last major abstraction from <span class="process-math">\(\Z\)</span> is the division algorithm. The main obstacle to postulating domains with a division algorithm is a clear notion of comparison relations. That is, if <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is an arbitrary domain with <span class="process-math">\(r,s\in R\text{,}\)</span> is it possible to clearly and sensibly say which of <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> is “bigger” ? (Recall that this was a requirement for the division algorithm with nonzero remainders.) However, if there is a way to relate elements of a domain <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\N_0\text{,}\)</span> we can sensibly define a division algorithm.</div>
