<div class="para">One of the most beautiful consequences of an abstract study of algebra is the fact that both <span class="process-math">\(\Z\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(F[x]\)</span> are Euclidean domains. While they are not “the same”, we can expect them to share many of the same properties. In this section, our first goal will be to extend familiar properties from <span class="process-math">\(\Z\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(F[x]\text{.}\)</span> We will also see that particular features of a polynomial (e.g., its degree, or the existence of roots) allows for additional criteria for its irreducibility to be decided.</div>
