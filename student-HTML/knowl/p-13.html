<p>Pedagogically, these notes fall under the big tent of <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">inquiry-based learning</em> (IBL). Broadly, there are several types of statements you'll find as you read these notes.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p><em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Theorems</em>: A <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">numbered</em> theorem is a statement that students are expected to prove for themselves. The authors generally assign 3â€“6 numbered theorems (or exercises, or lemmas) for each class meeting, with students expected to present their work during the next class. These presentations and the ensuing discussions form the regular work of the class. Students are <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">not</em> expected to prove <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">unnumbered</em> theorems. The unnumbered theorems unify nearby numbered theorems (such as stating an existence theorem and uniqueness theorem as a single result), or are otherwise too technical or complicated to be illuminating. Nonetheless, they are generally important results of which students should be aware.</p></li>
<li><p><em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Lemmas</em>: There are a few lemmas in the notes. As a rule, these lemmas pull out a step from nearby theorems that might be too big to reasonably expect students to take by themselves. If you would like to suggest additional lemmas, feel free to get in touch with the authors.</p></li>
<li><p><em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Exercises</em>: The exercises are generally computational in nature, and presage an upcoming generalization (or reinforce a recent theorem). They are generally labeled as <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Activity</em>, <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Exploration</em>, or <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Investigation</em>. As such, more than a correct numerical answer is needed for a good solution to an exercise.</p></li>
<li><p><em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Challenges</em>: There are a few (unnumbered) challenge problems in the text. These problems may be assigned or they may not, but they are generally difficult and their omission will not disrupt the flow of the text. Students may be interested merely in knowing their statements (e.g., <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(\Z[x]\)</span> is not a PID).</p></li>
