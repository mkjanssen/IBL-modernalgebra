<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">If the only rings that existed were polynomial rings, familiar systems of numbers like \(\Z, \Q, \R, \C\text{,}\) and matrix rings, there would still be enough to justify the defining the concept of a ring and exploring its properties. However, these are not the only rings that exist. In this section, we explore a way of building new rings from old by means of ideals. To better understand these new rings, we will also define two new classes of ideals: prime ideals, and maximal ideals. We end by briefly connecting these rings to a familiar problem from high school algebra.</p>
