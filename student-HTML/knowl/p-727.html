<div class="para">If the only rings that existed were polynomial rings, familiar systems of numbers like <span class="process-math">\(\Z, \Q, \R, \C\text{,}\)</span> and matrix rings, there would still be enough to justify defining the concept of a ring and exploring its properties. However, these are not the only rings that exist. In this section, we explore a way of building new rings from old by means of ideals. To better understand these new rings, we will also define two new classes of ideals: prime ideals, and maximal ideals. We end by briefly connecting these rings to a familiar problem from high school algebra.</div>
