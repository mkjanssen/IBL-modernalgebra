<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">This book was written in response to a bit of student feedback from one of the author's (Janssen) first time teaching his institution's introduction to abstract algebra. In short, the feedback was: <em class="emphasis">I am a future teacher, and I do not know why I had to take this course</em>. The criticism was fair; much of what we had covered that semester did not look like what one typically thinks of as “algebra”, yet it definitely was. In the intervening years, we set out to rethink the way we introduce students to this beautiful subject, and subsequently developed this free resource to do so.</p>
