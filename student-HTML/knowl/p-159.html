<p>Note that when <span class="process-math">\(n = 2\text{,}\)</span> there is such an expression, so let <span class="process-math">\(k &gt; 2\)</span> be the least positive integer that fails to be expressed as above. We note that <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> cannot be prime, or it could be expressed as above. Thus, by Theorem 2.1, there is a prime <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(k = p b\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(1 \lt p, b \lt k\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> was the least positive integer that cannot be factored as a product of primes, <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> has a prime factorization. But then so does <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> a contradiction.</p>
