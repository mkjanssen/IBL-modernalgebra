<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><p>Suppose <span class="process-math">\(2 = ab\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(4 = \delta(2) = \delta(a)\delta(b)\text{.}\)</span> By the lemma, we may not have <span class="process-math">\(\delta(a) = 2\text{,}\)</span> which means without loss of generality that <span class="process-math">\(\delta(a) = 1\text{,}\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is a unit. Therefore, 2 is irreducible.</p>
<p>Now suppose that <span class="process-math">\(1 + \sqrt{-7} = ab\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(8 = \delta(1+\sqrt{-7}) = \delta(a) \delta(b)\text{.}\)</span> The possible values for <span class="process-math">\(\delta(a)\)</span> are 1, 2, 4, and 8. If <span class="process-math">\(\delta(a) = 1\)</span> or 8, then <span class="process-math">\(1+\sqrt{-7}\)</span> is irreducible, as either <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is necessarily a unit. By the lemma, we may not have <span class="process-math">\(\delta(a) = 2\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\delta(b) = 2\text{,}\)</span> so in fact either <span class="process-math">\(\delta(a) = 1\)</span> or 8. Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(1\pm \sqrt{-7}\)</span> is irreducible.</p>
<p>Since we have factored 8 into two different products of irreducibles, <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is not a UFD.</p></article></body>
